educationalcontenttype_desc_amphibianextinctioncrisis.txt= "Summary: Since the 1980s there has been a rapid decline in amphibian population size and many local extinctions of species. The rate of biodiversity loss of amphibians is dramatic and thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including disease, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and pesticides.\n\nResearch of amphibian ecology over the past 30 years discovered some alarming results: 32% of amphibian species are under threat and 43% are in decline, many of which have been declared extinct in recent years. The extinction crisis is a symptom of various other conservation issues such as climate change, deforestation, habitat destruction and population fragmentation. As a result of this, amphibians are the most threatened group of vertebrates.\n\nIn terms of public awareness of global conservation topics, the amphibian extinction crisis is relatively unknown and the first signs of a problem were met with scepticism. This has meant that reaction has been slow – the impact of this is that the biodiversity loss has reached such a crisis level that it is thought that many amphibian species will not survive or recover without assistance. To prevent this, many species have now been introduced into zoos and captive breeding programmes in hopes of conserving them.\n\nAmphibian conservation and research groups are raising awareness of the problem while also protecting vulnerable species where possible. The mountain yellow-legged frog, which lives in the mountains of Nevada, USA, is a good example. The species is adapted to live in high-altitude rivers, lakes and streams where there are no natural aquatic predators. However, humans have introduced trout to the mountains for game purposes; the trout prey upon the frogs and tadpoles and have caused a huge drop in population. This in turn has caused many local extinctions, with complete extinction expected to follow if nothing is done. The local group Centre for Biological Diversity has campaigned for the frogs and their habitat to be protected, which is now beginning to be enforced. However, there is a long way to go if the yellow-legged frog populations are to recover."
educationalcontenttype_desc_beedecline.txt= "Summary: Research suggests that the last decade has seen a significant decrease in the number of bee colonies worldwide. This has devastating implications for agriculture, which relies on bees for pollination.\n\nBees are vital to humans; an instrumental part of the plant pollination process that provides us with food. Honeybees are especially significant because they are what are called 'faithful' pollinators, meaning they often stick to one species of flower until it stops flowering. This increases the chance of the right pollen fertilising the correct species of flower.\n\nAn alarming trend in bee colonies over the last 10 to 15 years is the high rate of deaths, with the percentage increasing greatly between 2006 and 2016. This problem has been called 'Colony Collapse Disorder' – or CCD – and has been studied extensively. There are thought to be many factors responsible for it including air pollution, parasites and pesticides, the latter of which are thought to be a particular problem for honeybees. This is due to their tendency to stick to single-flower species for long periods, meaning they are likely to pick up high concentrations of pesticides when foraging on agricultural plants.\n\nOne parasite that is also causing many problems is the Varroa mite, which attaches itself to bees and sucks their blood. The mite is especially dangerous if it gets into a colony, reproducing quickly because of the large number of hosts, weakening bees and making them less likely to forage effectively and return to the colony. The mites will also attack developing larva, meaning that newborn bees emerge already weakened.\n\nTo protect the bee populations, some areas of the world (such as within the EU) have limited the use of pesticides that are especially harmful to them. The EU also encourages farmers to leave small areas of their land to grow wild, increasing the amount of pesticide-free wildflowers for pollinators to feed on. Beekeepers can also treat their colonies to get rid of Varroa mite infestations. Although CCD remains a problem for bees, research continues and management of the issue is improving."
educationalcontenttype_desc_deforestation.txt= "Summary: Deforestation is when large amounts of trees are cleared for lumber – or to provide space for farming, mining and urban development. It is estimated that 18 million acres of forest are chopped down every year and, at this point, 50% of the world's tropical forests have been destroyed.\n\nAlthough deforestation is a problem all over the world, tropical rainforests are especially at risk. Our rainforests are a unique environment with a high level of biodiversity, providing a habitat for a huge number of animals; as this habitat is destroyed, many of these species are in turn becoming endangered. Large amounts in Asia have been cleared to make more space for palm oil plantations, which are in increasing demand due to the use of palm oil in so many food and cosmetic products. In Malaysia, this is specifically responsible for the endangerment of orang-utans; much of their habitat has been destroyed and it is now far more difficult for them to find food and mates.\n\nIn South America, too, the Amazon rainforest is being cut down – in this instance to create space to farm cattle or to plant soybeans, oil palms and other crops that can grow on the low-nutrient soil that is left behind after deforestation. Mining is a problem to a slightly lesser degree, with space being created to mine the many mineral deposits in the ground of the Amazon basin, including copper, tin, manganese, iron ore and gold. Additionally, deforestation is also a compounding factor of climate change; decreasing forest area means less carbon dioxide is taken from the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis.\n\nPeople can work against deforestation by boycotting products that do not contain sustainable palm oil, and by buying recycled paper and card products."
educationalcontenttype_desc_ecotourism.txt= "Summary: The desire to visit exotic and beautiful places has caused damage to environments across the world due to high amounts of tourism traffic. Ecotourism attempts to allow people to visit interesting places non-invasively, maintaining the fragile natural balance of the area.\n\nEcotourism aims to educate visitors on the environment and wildlife they are observing, while also making money to benefit local people and fund conservation work. It also often raises awareness of local environmental issues and promotes behaviour that assists positive environmental impact. This is often done on a much smaller scale to commercial tourism.\n\nThe Galapagos Islands are an excellent example of where ecotourism has been implemented effectively. Due to being separated from the mainland for millennia, islands often have very fragile ecosystems and distinctive wildlife communities; the Galapagos are particularly famous because they were visited by Charles Darwin on the Beagle Voyage, where he made the observations that led to his theory of evolution.\n\nMost of the Galapagos Islands are now national parks, meaning that people who wish to visit usually have to go as part of an ecotourism venture that follows strict rules. Tourists are only allowed to visit certain areas in small numbers and are transported on boats owned by locals, while a proportion of the money made on these visits is used to protect and conserve the islands.\n\nPeople can facilitate environmentally friendly tourism by choosing to go on tours with small, locally-owned trip providers that provide an educational aspect on the local environment. People can also look into damage that may be caused by certain types of trips – for example, some whale and dolphin watching tour providers use noisy, highly polluting boats and will attempt to get very close to the animals, which causes them distress and increases the chance of harm. Eco-friendly tours will use small, quiet boats and stay a respectable distance away from any animals."
educationalcontenttype_desc_globalwarming.txt= "Summary: Climate change is a natural process throughout Earth's history, occurring gradually over tens of thousands of years and causing ice age cycles. However, the human impact on earth over the past century – specifically, the burning of fossil fuels, mass deforestation, soil degradation and increased agriculture – has caused the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere to rise to unprecedented levels.\n\nHumans have been burning coal, natural gas and oil as fuel sources since the industrial revolution – the fuel expenditure from which has allowed for the use of heavy machinery and an increased rate of development. However, it also leads to a release of 'greenhouse gases' such as carbon dioxide and methane into the air, which collect and create an insulating layer in the atmosphere. This causes the sun's heat to reflect back towards Earth to warm the overall surface temperature of the planet.\n\nThe effects of climate change are only further compounded by deforestation and agriculture. The former removes huge amounts of trees from the landscape, which would naturally remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. Meanwhile, certain types of agriculture, such as beef farming, increase the greenhouse gases via animal's methane emissions. Lastly, the combination of intensive arable farming, deforestation and mining causes soil degradation and the loss of a 'carbon sink' – a large and stable area of carbon compound storage.\n\nClimate change is affecting the entire world; from more extreme weather conditions, to the melting of polar ice causing sea level rises, to ocean temperature increases causing vast damage to marine environments such as coral reefs. It is putting the planet's ecosystem in general under extreme stress.\n\nIn order to reduce carbon emissions, 195 countries agreed to reduce their output as part of the Paris Agreement; an initiative that was started to mitigate the effects of climate change. This has facilitated the reduction of fossil fuel use and introduced environmental taxes on big businesses. On an individual level, people can reduce their carbon footprint by eating less meat – especially beef – and decreasing their fuel consumption by driving and flying less, instead using alternative modes of transport where possible."
educationalcontenttype_desc_invasivespecies.txt= "Summary: When an alien species is introduced to a new environment, often they cannot adapt and do not survive. However, occasionally a species is introduced that is able to take advantage of the new conditions extremely effectively and can overrun the area, damaging native environments and outcompeting local animals.\n\nHumans have been able to inhabit and travel between almost all environment types on Earth; the large amount of human traffic has introduced species to areas of the planet that they otherwise would never have got to. This has happened both accidentally, such as animals stowing away on cargo ships; and intentionally, such as species being introduced as a method of biological pest control.\n\nA mistakenly introduced species that has caused huge problems across the world is the zebra mussel – a shellfish named after its distinctive black and white stripes. They are native to the Caspian Sea and Black Sea, but have subsequently been introduced to waterways across the world after being transported on the bottom of ships in the 1800s. In North America and Europe, they have formed massive clumps that have damaged pipes, harbours and water treatment plants, and have also out-competed and smothered local aquatic species.\n\nAnother example is the cane toad, which was introduced to Australia intentionally in 1935 to eat beetles that were damaging sugar cane crops. Now, there are an estimated 200 million toads causing a huge amount of damage to the local environment. One such impact is the toxins on their skin which native predators have no resistance to, so when alligators, snakes, birds and other animals eat cane toads, they are often poisoned. Additionally, toads often eat dung beetles, but the large number of toads mean that dung beetles are over predated, causing a reduction in the decomposition of cow dung which, in turn, increased the contraction of diseases in cattle. This negative effect at multiple levels of the food chain is known as 'trophic cascade'.\n\nGovernments attempt to prevent the spread of invasive species by enforcing strict customs rules regarding the spread of live animals, food and plants. Many countries will raise awareness of problem species so that the public inform the authorities if an individual is spotted, and measures can be taken to remove the animal."
educationalcontenttype_desc_landsharingversuslandsparing.txt= "Summary: As the total human population of Earth increases, there are more people to feed but less space for farmland. The land sharing versus land sparing debate aims to determine what is better for sustainable agriculture; high yield farming on small areas of land (land sparing), or low yield farming across a larger area that allows biodiversity to be preserved on the agricultural land (land sharing).\n\nThis debate is a hot topic among conservation research – there has been a lot of discourse into which type of farming is better overall for the environment, and each has its pros and cons. On one hand, high intensity farms are likely to use more pesticides and fertilizer, and cause soil degradation through heavy planting in small areas. On the other hand, low intensity farms are likely to negatively impact a wider range of wildlife communities gradually over a larger area.\n\nIn terms of a positive impact, land sharing farms are more likely to have insect and bird life, due to the reduced use of pesticides and having hedgerows dividing fields. More insects mean greater pollination on farms, and more birds mean less pests on crops. Land sparing farms allow for more land that has not been changed by agriculture.\n\nDifferent researchers have drawn different conclusions about what is better long term depending on the types of farms that have been researched. Both sides have positives and negatives; some research suggests that the most environmentally conscious farms should be a combination of both, and that both land sparing and land sharing techniques can be used in combination to provide the best outlook for the local environment."
educationalcontenttype_desc_poaching.txt= "Summary: Every year across the world, many wild and exotic animals are captured to be sold illegally as pets. The demand for these unusual creatures is high, so much so that poachers can make a lot of money providing live specimens to buyers.\n\nHumans have sought exotic pets and unusual animals for centuries, the desire for which has only grown as knowledge of them has increased. Poachers can make large profits by capturing and smuggling different species – in particular smaller exotic birds, snakes, frogs and fish, which are often at higher risk because they are easier to transport to locations of sale.\n\nThis activity is not only detrimental to the individual animal in question - which is likely to be transported in poor conditions and put into the care of someone ill-equipped to properly care for them - but these illegal sales also cause issues for the environment that the animal was taken from, causing a decline in the population numbers of any species targeted by the exotic pet trade. For example, it is estimated that 80% of Indonesia's green python population has been exported illegally as pets. This sort of overexploitation could cause a species to go extinct in the wild.\n\nAn additional problem is that the capture of animals often results in the illegal killing of others. Primates in particular suffer from this problem, as poachers will kill many adults in a group in order to reach their infants. For chimps, this will then mean that the adults' bodies will be sold as bushmeat, while the infant will be trafficked to buyers in areas across the world. Baby chimps are popular in some areas of the Middle East, South East Asia and China.\n\nOrganisations such as the World Wildlife Fund are working to reduce this illegal trafficking, attempting to prevent poaching by employing rangers to protect environments where vulnerable animals live. As well as this, they are also investigating trade routes often used by smugglers, encouraging the enforcement of protective legislation by governments, and educating people to reduce the demand for exotic pets."
educationalcontenttype_desc_populationfragmentation.txt= "Summary: Population fragmentation occurs when a group of animals is split apart, and can be caused by a variety of mechanisms both natural and man-made. The former is primarily natural disasters, but it can also happen for a group to take better advantage of resources elsewhere. Man-made causes include deforestation, urbanisation and agricultural land conversion.\n\nPopulation fragmentation causes difficulties to the communities of animals it affects; for example, depending on the severity of the fragmentation, it may become difficult for them to find mates, while habitat destruction will increase competition for food and territory. If the pressures causing habitat fragmentation continue, then the population groups will become smaller in number and spread further apart. Along with smaller populations being more vulnerable to disease and predation, a small number of individuals who repeatedly reproduce with each other may suffer from inbreeding depression. This is when low genetic diversity causes weakened individuals within a population because there's an increased likelihood of harmful recessive traits appearing.\n\nThe Iberian lynx is an example of a species that was at one point on the verge of extinction due to population fragmentation. It is a wild cat that inhabits the plains and mountains of Spain, but its population was reduced down to only 100 individuals in 2005, partially due to extensive habitat loss isolating them to two small populations in the mountains. The lack of hunting ground and the spread of disease almost wiped out the lynx, but they were saved through captive breeding and reintroduction to their previous habitat, as well as ensuring they had enough prey to feed on. As a result, they are no longer critically endangered.\n\nPopulation fragmentation can be mitigated by conservation that works to prevent habitat destruction and create 'wildlife corridors', which allow animals to safely travel between populations."
educationalcontenttype_desc_repairoftheozonelayer.txt= "Summary: The ozone layer is a part of the Earth's atmosphere that is made of ozone molecules (O3), and which absorbs 97-99% of the harmful UV radiation emitted by the sun. It became damaged in the 1980s but following a reduction in the use of chemicals responsible for the damage, it has now begun to repair.\n\nThe damage to the ozone layer was caused by man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons – or CFCs – which were widespread and commonly used in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. These chemicals react with ozone, breaking down the ring structure of the O3 molecule and binding with the oxygen atoms, remaining in the atmosphere without breaking down. As more CFCs entered the atmosphere, more ozone was broken down and large 'holes' of significant O3 depletion appeared in the layer, the most significant area of which occurred above Antarctica.\n\nThe depletion of the ozone layer was first noticed in the mid-1980s and continued throughout the 90's. In 1985 and 1987, many countries signed the 'Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer' and 'Montreal Protocol' respectively, agreeing to tackle the problem. Measures were taken to reduce the number of CFCs being introduced into the atmosphere, and the amount of ozone in the atmosphere stopped decreasing and remained at a steady level, but still with significant damage.\n\nDepleted levels of ozone in the atmosphere allows more ultraviolet radiation to pass through, increasing the risk of skin cancer and other forms of sun damage. The more depleted the ozone layer, the less natural protection the planet has from solar radiation.\n\nSince 2016, NASA has observed that the ozone layer has begun to recover from the damage it sustained in the 70s, 80s and 90s, with ozone beginning to slowly build up again in the 'holes'. If progress continues and there is no further damage, it is estimated that the layer could recover by 2060."
educationalcontenttype_desc_traditionalmedicine.txt= "Summary: In many areas of the world, animal parts are sought after for ingredients in traditional medicine. Traditional remedies are not based on scientific research on their effectiveness, but on folklore passed down through generations. The demands for certain ingredients have caused animals to become endangered or even extinct due to overexploitation.\n\nIn some areas of Africa and Asia, traditional medicine is used for the majority of treatment of ailments, and the demand for animal ingredients has created a lucrative business for poachers and smugglers. Animals that have been extremely negatively affected due to being widely hunted for ingredients include rhinos, pangolins, sea horses, moon bears and tigers.\n\nRhino horn is demanded in traditional medicine across the world. In Chinese traditional medicine, rhino horn is believed to cure fever, high blood pressure, rheumatism and gout as well as many other health issues, but there is absolutely zero scientific evidence to support that rhino horn can do this. All 5 species of rhino are near extinction due to being poached for their horns, with the western black rhinoceros being officially declared extinct in 2011.\n\nThe problem with traditional medicine is how pervasive and deeply ingrained the belief in its efficacy is, and often the practice is cultural and tied to a country's history. While there is still demand for animal products, animals are still in danger even if hunting them is made illegal. There are organisations that are working to educate people in areas where traditional medicine is prevalent and offering herbal alternatives to animal products. Many animals that are sought after in traditional medicine are now heavily protected.\n\nCharities such as the World Wildlife Fund are tackling the illegal wildlife trade in live animals and animal products by increasing the number of rangers who protect environments where these animals live, searching vehicles on routes used by smugglers, assisting governments in creating more protective legislation and educating people to lower the desire for ingredients derived from endangered animals."

But, never one to be complacent, Bernard now wants to see what you can do in this most promising of locations."
frontendmenu_scenariodetails_scenario_03.txt= "Panda Park is Bernard Goodwin's newest zoo, built from the ground up to celebrate the Panda in all its forms.

The park is currently in a state of development with some attractions only half-complete, are you the right person to take them over the finish line?"
frontendmenu_scenariodetails_scenario_06.txt= "Situated in a sun-drenched corner of Greece, Myers Lake Island Zoo is Dominic Myers' first foray into the world of zoo-building. As such he's started small. And then crammed as much into it as he could. These two elements have combined to make a somewhat sub-par zoo, so there's plenty of room for improvement. Assuming you can first find the space for it."
frontendmenu_scenariodetails_scenario_07.txt= "Myers Animal Entertainment Park is Dominic's attempt to turn around his image in India by repurposing a casino he'd previously built - a casino which was tacky even by the impressive standards of casinos. As a result, this hastily flung-together zoo has more serious issues than a complete set of Very Important News, and it's up to you to fix them all."
frontendmenu_scenariodetails_scenario_08.txt= "There's something in the air at the site of the brand new Myers Rainforest Conservation Project, but it's not excitement, and it smells really bad. It's difficult enough building a zoo from the ground up, but in this case you'll be starting from well below ground level in a disused quarry. And as it's a new zoo, you can expect plenty of teething problems. But as Dominic might say, you're the just dummy to placate them."
frontendmenu_scenariodetails_scenario_09.txt= "Myers Sunshine Happiness Zoo promises a lot with its name and is failing to deliver on almost all of it.

frontendmenu_scenariodetails_scenario_10.txt= "Nestled within a rocky valley and atop a small mesa, Emma Goodwin's first zoo is also intended to be a world's first - a zoo with as much diversity in its flora as its fauna and with peerless environmental credentials. Without a doubt, the Nevada State Eco-Zoo is a big swing for the fences, and guess who's up at bat?"
frontendmenu_scenariodetails_scenario_11.txt= "Abandoned by its previous owner, the Yamaguchi Prefecture Tranquillity Zoo is anything but at the moment, lacking both animals and any sense of tranquillity.

frontendmenu_scenariodetails_scenario_12.txt= "Intended to both honour the legacy of the late, great Bernard Goodwin as well as drive the slyly wily (or infelicitous duplicitous) Dominic Myers out of business, The Bernie Goodwin Memorial Zoo sits atop a small island in the Upper Bay of New York. Or rather it will, once it's been built. It's do or die, sink or swim and strive or thrive, but who will emerge victorious?"

It may be necessary to adopt, separate or remove animals to find the right balance. Some animals prefer large herds, others prefer a solitary lifestyle and these setups are necessary to maintain an animal's social welfare. You can find detailed information on this in the Zoopedia. [nl]  [nl] Note: Juveniles are not considered when looking at the makeup of a social group, but do affect space requirements. [nl]  [nl] The balance of males and females in a group can also play an important role in maintaining healthy environments. Dominance fights may occur when a sex is numerically above its recommended level. Animals in same-sex groups are more tolerant of each other, and often have higher recommended group numbers. [nl]  [nl] Animals that exceed their species’ population limits become Outsiders within their habitat. Outsiders are the target of dominance fights by all other members of the established social group, and are prevented from otherwise engaging in social interactions with other animals. It is a good idea to remove Outsiders until the group makeup is acceptable to the species again to avoid injury and death of animals as a consequence of these fights. [nl] You can read more about Outsider relationships in the linked topic below. [nl]  [nl] Some species have the notion of alphas. Alphas hold a social status within the group, these are often male but in some species may be female. Alpha status confers the right to breed with other animals in the group and therefore is a desirable position. In species that exhibit alpha behaviour, groups that are non-bachelor in makeup will compete to earn the rank of alpha, this often results in fighting to determine a winner. [nl]  [nl] Group sexual dynamics also vary between species. This is detailed in the Zoopedia where they are assigned the following labels: [nl]  [nl] • Monogamous – a male and female exclusively mate with each other [nl] • Promiscuous – both males and females mate with multiple partners [nl] • Polygynous – one male mates with multiple females [nl] • Polyandrous – one female mates with multiple males"

l10_feedback_timer_wolves_01.txt= "Aw, I don't think I was quite prepared for just how cute those Timber Wolf pups would be! Oh, and the people from the Timber Wolf Ecology Restoration Project are thrilled as well!"

l10_feedback_timer_wolves_03.txt= "It's really sad to see those Timber Wolves go, but the Timber Wolf Ecology Restoration Project is an important cause. Just a few more releases and we'll have fulfilled our promise to them!"
l10_feedback_timer_wolves_04.txt= "That's the last Timber Wolf release. They're such noble creatures... Well done!"
l10_feedback_trees.txt= "Now, be honest - you're really enjoying all these different trees, aren't you? Of course you are. Just a few more different species and we'll have hit our targets!"
l10_gold_achieved_01.txt= "What?! I could never have imagined that our first zoo would be this successful! Oh, and I could not have done it without you. Thanks to your efforts we've made an incredible contribution to the Timber Wolf Ecology Restoration Project. And, even better, the zoo is running completely on renewables. I mean, I know this is what I asked for, but I just didn't believe we'd make it this far, so fast!"
l10_gold_achieved_02.txt= "You know, other than the animals, you really were the only good thing about Mr Myers' zoos. Oh, and now that he doesn't have you working for him, he's really cutting costs to the bone. I hear he actually tried passing off a habitat full of house-cats as "pygmy lions"! Ugh! I mean, the sooner we get rid of him, the better!"
l10_intro_01.txt= "Welcome to your new zoo! This should be a much more pleasant experience for you than your recent ones. And it should be more exciting, too! Just not in a "Will I eventually be arrested for being a part of this?" way as it was with Mr Myers."
l10_intro_02.txt= "Not that your work won't be challenging - I mean, I want this zoo to become a paragon of eco-friendliness. You might say we want to have a small carbon paw-print… Aw, c'mon, no? Nothing? Fine."
l10_intro_03.txt= "Oh, and part of our conservation effort is going to involve increasing the bio-diversity of the trees in the zoo! See? Didn't I tell you it was gonna be exciting?"
l10_intro_04.txt= "Oh and last, but not least, the zoo will be participating in a scheme to increase the number of wild Timber Wolves. Y'know, actually, one of Mr Myers's zoos was going to contribute over two dozen Timber Wolves to the project. That is until the organisers realised it was just one wolf and a set of mirrors..."

l11_bengaltiger_1.txt= "Our first animal has arrived! Go find them in the Animal Rewards."
l11_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "Wow, I never visited this zoo before the disaster, but given that it was one of Mr Myers', I think it's safe to say it's probably never looked better - outstanding work!"
l11_bronze_achieved_01_alt.txt= "Wow, goodness, you've utterly transformed this place, haven't you? It's just so wonderful to see the animals happily settled back into their habitats."
l11_bronze_achieved_02.txt= "I'm sure that in a few weeks you won't even be able to tell that a typhoon blew through here. Oh, well, assuming you ignore the trees full of broken umbrellas."
l11_bronze_achieved_03.txt= "Oh, but there is some bad news I'm afraid - our accountants just told me that Mr Myers sunk a ton of debt into this zoo before he abandoned it. Unfortunately that means it's up to us to pay it off!"
l11_bronze_achieved_04.txt= "Still, on the bright side a big batch of animals has just been delivered to the park. So get them settled in, and listen, don't worry too much about the debt."
l11_feedback_conservation.txt= "Look, I'm totally thrilled with how high our conservation rating is, but if we knuckle down, I bet we can get it even higher!"
l11_feedback_repair_habitats.txt= "Well, I'll be - you've repaired all the habitats! Good work!"
l11_gold_achieved_01.txt= "You know, I'm still in shock that we have been honoured so highly by being loaned Lin Lin! She's a bit of an international superstar, you know - I hear she's even got a book deal!"
l11_gold_achieved_02.txt= "Anyway, I think it's fair to say that Mr Myers' attempt to scapegoat you has failed quite thoroughly. Although that sounds about par for the course given that his zoos are failing left, right and centre."
l11_gold_achieved_03.txt= "And if they aren't collapsing because of mismanagement, then they're being taken away from him by local authorities - and he's had so many escapes that in one of his zoos apparently a hundred percent of the animals were fakes! And not even convincing ones - they were mostly papier mâché."
l11_gold_achieved_04.txt= "Ugh! The sooner that awful man is out of this business, the sooner I'll breathe a sigh of relief!"
l11_intro_01.txt= "Well, I am thrilled to report that our work in the United States has caught the attention of the World Association of Zoos, Zoological Organisations and Complementary or Kindred Societies - they've contacted us to request our assistance with an emergency!"
l11_intro_02.txt= "So, a zoo in Japan was just abandoned to avoid paying for the repairs. Now, I think you can probably guess who that previous owner was, too..."
l11_intro_03.txt= "Mr Myers."
l11_intro_04.txt= "Dominic Myers? Sorry, it's just that you didn't say anything. Look, I don't mind telling you, this isn't the first one of his failed zoos I've had to purchase…"
l11_intro_05.txt= "Okay, anyway, thankfully all of the animals are in fine fettle, having been taken into care. But they can't stay there indefinitely, so we need to make repairs as swiftly as possible and give those animals a home again. Although I suppose technically their giant tortoise already has one. Hahaha..."
l11_intro_06.txt= "Okay, okay, come on, there's a lot to do and very little time! Oh, and even less money - so we will need to take out a loan..."
l11_nilemnitor_1.txt= "Looks like two new animals have arrived. You better to collect them!"
l11_nyalarhino_01.txt= "A couple of new animals have arrived!"
l11_post-silver_01.txt= "Oh my! I've just received the most amazing news - Lin Lin the Panda is going to be loaned to us! Now the investigators have completely exonerated you - apparently they always suspected Mr Myers was up to something."
l11_post-silver_02.txt= "Anyway - I know this is very last-minute, but I don't suppose you could build a suitable habitat for Lin Lin, could you?"
l11_silver_achieved_01.txt= "Wow, you've really done us proud by passing that inspection! The World Association of Zoos, Zoological Organisations and Complementary or Kindred Societies  could not be more impressed with your efforts in getting all those animals rehomed so quickly."
l11_silver_achieved_02.txt= "They actually told me they were considering giving us an award, but hey I told them not to bother because the work itself was reward enough."
l11_silver_achieved_03.txt= "Oh and, also, it would have been made out of single-use plastic..."
l11_silver_achieved_03_alt01.txt= "Plus there was no cash alternative. Saving the planet is not cheap, you know..."
l11_silver_achieved_03_alt02.txt= "Also because the award was a free meal at a restaurant with terrible vegetarian options..."
l11_silver_achieved_03_alt03.txt= "And because my mantelpiece is absolutely heaving already."
l11_silver_achieved_03_alt04.txt= "I have regretted that decision ever since."
l11_silver_achieved_04.txt= "Oh, and you won't believe what I just heard. That debt I told you about earlier? Just the tip of the iceberg. The accountants have discovered even more holes in the books and we've got to fill them!"
l11_silver_achieved_05.txt= "Good news though - Our final batch of animals has been returned to the zoo! Ooh, and make sure they're happy for when the reporter arrives."
l11_timberwolf_01.txt= "Your next batch of animals is here."
l12_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "Whoa! You've certainly been keeping an eye out for Mr Myers's troublemakers, haven't you? Okay, but he's got deep pockets so don't expect the disturbances to stop any time soon. Not least because we're right next to New York and I think one of their baseball teams just beat the other and the fans are not happy. On the bright side, we're already getting great press for the zoo. I just hope that Mr Myers is starting to feel the pressure..."
l12_bronze_achieved_02.txt= "Well this is impressive - I never even considered opening a zoo in New York. Emma's really put her old man to shame, hasn't she?"
l12_bronze_achieved_03.txt= "What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost!"
l12_bronze_achieved_04.txt= "Sorry to surprise you like this, but I'm happy to say the reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated. I won't go into the details right now but I have had quite the adventure in the Arctic Circle. Although nothing compared to what I hear you've been through!"
l12_bronze_achieved_05.txt= "I know, I know - I'm just as shocked as you were. I would have mentioned it earlier but I only found out yesterday and he swore me to silence. Isn't this simply wonderful?"
l12_bronze_achieved_06.txt= "Ooh, and I suppose this means I'm going to have to change the name of the zoo..."
l12_feedback_animal_welfare.txt= "Wow! I must say, I'm very impressed with the zoo's animal welfare rating - you're really keeping on top of things! Keep it up!"
l12_feedback_criminals.txt= "Your staff's doing a great job of stopping all those troublemakers! But we can't get complacent!"
l12_feedback_total_species_01.txt= "I see the expansion is going according to plan - well done! And with just a few more different species we'll have hit our goals!"
l12_feedback_total_species_02.txt= "Just one more species and we'll have done it!"
l12_gold_achieved_01.txt= "You know, I was thinking that after I'd had a rest, I'd get back into the zoo-building business. But now I've seen first-hand how well Emma's handling it I think I might retire instead..."
l12_gold_achieved_02.txt= "Well... Maybe not just yet..."
l12_gold_achieved_03.txt= "Congratulations - I knew you were good... but I never could have imagined how good!"
l12_gold_achieved_04.txt= "Hahaha! We've done it! The state government has stepped in and shut down his zoo! All of the animals are being rehomed as I speak - they won't suffer at Mr Myers's hand any longer. And the details are already all over the news... Hahaha! With the amount of violations they found, no-one will ever let him open a zoo again! Anywhere! Ha! His reputation is in complete tatters!"
l12_gold_achieved_05.txt= "I can't believe it's over..."
l12_gold_achieved_06.txt= "Now, I know, I know I've always been a bit more "big picture" than my father - more concerned about saving the entire planet than the individual animals on it - but this whole experience has really taught me the value of balancing the needs of both."
l12_gold_achieved_07.txt= "One thing's for sure - it's a job that never truly ends. We might have gotten rid of Mr Myers, but there's plenty more work for all of us to do! And there's nobody I'd rather do it with than you!"
l12_intro_01.txt= "You and I are going to put Mr Myers out of business for good. In every sense of the word."
l12_intro_02.txt= "Now, I've purchased a small island near his remaining zoo. It's not big, but it's an attractive enough destination that it should draw customers away from Mr Myers's establishment."
l12_intro_03.txt= "But don't imagine for one minute that he'll make it easy for us. You'll constantly have to be on the look-out for criminal ne'er-do-wells and also a laptop bag which I lost when I was surveying the site. Wait, you know what, forget the bag - you just worry about the troublemakers."
l12_intro_04.txt= "Listen, if we want drive Mr Myers out of the zoo business - for the good of animals everywhere - then our zoo will have to be the best zoo the world's ever seen. We'll have to have the happiest animals and the happiest guests, and that means having the happiest staff as well. But also we can't ignore our conservation responsibilities in pursuit of those goals. We have to be peerless at everything."
l12_intro_05.txt= "However, if I've learned anything, it's that if there's one person who can build this zoo, it's you..."
l12_intro_06.txt= "Or me, but I'll be much too busy. Good luck."
l12_silver_achieved_01.txt= "The good press is really picking up steam - and the cracks are starting to show at Mr Myers's zoo! Literally - I have no idea what he built those habitats from but he's leaking animals everywhere."
l12_silver_achieved_02.txt= "Okay, listen, this is it - the final push - we're so close to putting him out of business I can feel it in my stomach!"
l12_silver_achieved_03.txt= "Although that might be because of the falafel I just ate - it was suspiciously meaty."
l12_silver_achieved_04.txt= "I know I'm late to the party about Emma's plan to drive that awful Dominic fellow out of business, but she's doing incredible work! If I had half the head on my shoulders that she does, I probably wouldn't have taken a wrong turn and spent the last three months living in an igloo..."
l1_bengal_adopt_01.txt= "Okay, that's the habitat boundary complete and the habitat gate in place. I think it's time to adopt some tigers."
l1_bengal_barrierheight_01.txt= "Now, Bernie takes safety very seriously as his zoos, so we should probably make sure those tigers can't jump out of their habitat, don't you think? The way we'll do it is by changing the height of the habitat's barrier."
l1_bengal_barrierheight_02.txt= "Okay then, you should start by double-clicking the habitat barrier, which will take you into Barrier Editing Mode."
l1_bengal_barrierheight_03.txt= "Great. Now, highlight the entire perimeter of the habitat. You can do that by clicking and dragging the habitat barrier selection tool."
l1_bengal_barrierheight_04.txt= "Now you've got all of the perimeter selected, you can increase the height of it by clicking and dragging the barrier height tool upwards. You'll want to make sure it reaches a height of at least three point seven metres."
l1_bengal_barrierheight_05.txt= "Okay, that's the habitat boundary complete, the habitat gate in place and - most importantly - the tigers won't be able to jump out of it any more! I think it's time we adopted those tigers."
l1_bengal_barrier_01.txt= "Righty, your next job is to build a habitat - from scratch! And wood and concrete, I expect. So, go ahead and build it - and don't forget the habitat gate!"
l1_bengal_barrier_02.txt= "It's always best to place the habitat gate close to the keeper hut. As it happens, there's one quite near to the Trade Centre."
l1_bengal_barrier_02_alt.txt= "Righty, your next job is to build a habitat - from scratch! And concrete and glass, I expect. So, go ahead and build it - just make sure that the habitat includes that big hole we've dug. Oh, and don't forget to add a habitat gate to the barrier!"
l1_bengal_barrier_03.txt= "Oh, and make sure the guests will be able to see the tigers."
l1_bengal_barrier_04.txt= "Not like that, no - remember - you need to include the big hole we've dug inside of the barrier. I've got plans for that hole and they don't include the guests falling into it."
l1_bengal_donation_01.txt= "Now that the habitat is in place, don't forget to put down a Donation Box near to your viewing areas. We need every dollar we can get. Especially as these tigers aren't exactly eating instant noodles for lunch!"
l1_bengal_feeding_01.txt= "We'll start with the basics. Add a suitable feeding station for them."
l1_bengal_habitat_01.txt= "Whilst our trusty caretakers collect and deliver the tigers, let's take a look at preparing the habitat for their arrival."
l1_bengal_habitat_plants_01.txt= "Right then! All animals need plants and trees from their own biome or continent - you know, deserts, grasslands, or Asia, Europe - that sort of thing.  It looks like these tigers need a few more plants in their habitat...to get a perfect fit use plants from the tropical and temperate biomes that are native to Asia."
l1_bengal_habitat_plants_02.txt= "The tigers will also want a certain amount of their habitat to be covered by those plants. To find out which plants to use and how many, select a tiger and go to the Environment tab."
l1_bengal_habitat_plants_03.txt= "Now, as you can see some of the plants currently in the habitat aren't quite right for the tiger, like the wattle bushes. You can remove them if you want."
l1_bengal_habitat_plants_04.txt= "You can find all of the plants you need in the Nature section, and you can use the filters to only show the types of plants you want to see. In this case, that's plants from the Tropical or Temperate biomes and from the the Asian continent."
l1_bengal_habitat_pool_01.txt= "This time, instead of adding a water bowl let's try something different. Some animals need a pool in their habitat so they can go for a swim, but they can also use it to drink from. All you have to do is make sure the banks of the pool have a gentle slope so they can easily get a nice, refreshing drink. There's already a pool excavated but you still need to fill it with water. You should do that by going into Terrain and selecting the Water tool."
l1_bengal_habitat_shelter_01.txt= "Okay, it's really starting to take shape. Now, the Tigers will need a shelter in their habitat so they can hide from the guests - or more likely, the bad weather. Although, given that we're in England you might want to think of that just as normal weather. Go on, add a shelter to their habitat. You can either build one from various suitable bits and bobs or, if you like, just pop down the blueprint that I've already built for you."
l1_bengal_habitat_terrain_01.txt= "Aww, poor dabs! I'm sure it can't have escaped your attention that the tigers look a bit miffed. That's because they aren't too keen on the type of terrain in their habitat. Select a tiger and bring up its information panel."
l1_bengal_habitat_terrain_02.txt= "Righty-o! Click on the Terrain tab; that way, you can view the terrain information and see how they feel about the different types of terrain. That'll tell you what the tigers need more of or less of in this habitat."
l1_bengal_habitat_terrain_03.txt= "Okay then! Open the terrain editing tool, select Painting and give them some more soil. Yes, that should help with the Habitat part of their welfare."
l1_bengal_habitat_toys_01.txt= "Yes, that'll do nicely. Of course, just like the warthogs and ostriches, these tigers will also need some enrichment. Why don't you add some suitable toy and food enrichment items into their habitat?"
l1_bengal_intro.txt= "Let's get onto your next objective, then: Bengal tigers! We want to adopt some, but I'm afraid there's nothing ready for them yet. Head on over to the plot of land I've marked out - it's not too far away!"
l1_boxed_animals_01.txt= "Right, this animal's been boxed up, see, so you should probably unbox it, don't you think? Click on it, and then click "Unbox Animal"."
l1_boxed_animals_02.txt= "Looks like this animal's been boxed up, so you'd best get them unboxed, eh? Click on it, and then click "Unbox Animal"."
l1_boxed_animals_03.txt= "Well, look at that, one of your animals has been boxed up, how about you unbox it, eh?"
l1_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "Oh, good to see the ostriches have somewhere they can really stretch their legs! Did you know they can actually run at forty-three miles per hour? Ho ho! Heaven forbid they ever escape, heh - the speed camera fines alone would bankrupt us! Hah hah hah hah hah!"
l1_cameracontrols_01.txt= "But before we begin the real work, how about we familiarise you with the zoo by learning how to fly around it and visiting some of our beautiful animals? We'll start by popping over and having a looksie at the grizzly bears in their habitat."
l1_cameracontrols_grizzlies_01.txt= "Did you know that grizzly bears - also known as Ursus arctos horribilis - can hibernate for up to seven months a year? But then again, given the chance, I think a lot of people would do that, too."
l1_cameracontrols_grizzlies_02.txt= "Select one of the bears and you'll bring up its information panel."
l1_cameracontrols_grizzlies_03.txt= "This is where you can find out all kinds of information about your animal. The most important thing being its overall welfare."
l1_cameracontrols_grizzlies_04.txt= "You'll learn more about animal welfare today as we go through your objectives, but for now let's enjoy this magnificent animal. Why don't you select the camera at the bottom of its information panel?"
l1_cameracontrols_grizzlies_05.txt= "See now this is a fantastic way to get a close look at your animals. You can also get this view of an animal by simply double-clicking on it."
l1_cameracontrols_grizzlies_06.txt= "When you're ready, let's pop over to the other side of the zoo and take a look at the lions. I've marked their location for you to find."
l1_cameracontrols_lions_01.txt= "Panthera leo leo, or the West African Lion to you and me. Lions are the most social of the big cats, and there can be as many as 40 lions in a pride, although prides of that size are pretty rare."
l1_cameracontrols_lions_02.txt= "As Bernie would say, "Those lions are roarsome", which is precisely why I handle the training instead these days. Anyway, how about we get started on those objectives? Come on, let's head over to an empty habitat and see what needs doing there"
l1_game_speed_01.txt= "Ooh, by the way, as well as pausing the game you can to speed the game up by clicking on the fast forward button. It'll run everything at two times and five times faster. It can be useful, especially if you're waiting for money to accumulate or for animals to be delivered to your habitat. Personally, I use it when I'm waiting for a brew to finish..."
l1_gold_achieved_01.txt= "It sounds like you've got the whole zoo purring away nicely. Well, purring, grunting, screaming, booming - all the appropriate noises. I guess I was right to hire you, eh?"
l1_gold_achieved_02.txt= "Hah hah hah, don't tell her I told you, but Nancy wasn't sure you'd even last the morning, so we're happy this is working out. Also because it means Nancy owes me a Foxy Coffee."

I'm Bernard...although I insist you call me Bernie. The only person who calls me Bernard is my wife, and even then only when I've tracked elephant dung into the carpets!"
l1_intro_02.txt= "As you know I own several zoos, but I always like to show people the ropes here at my home. This is the first zoo I ever opened and a source of great pride for me, and prides, thanks to a lion breeding programme we ran in the 80s."
l1_intro_03.txt= "But, we're in the middle of a big renovation - and that's where you come in. Sadly, our old contractor had to retire after developing a fur allergy. Poor devil kept sneezing his dentures into the lion habitat, so it's up to you to finish everything off."
l1_intro_04.txt= "Don't worry, though - I'm not completely throwing you in at the deep end. My head keeper, Nancy Jones, will be lending a helping hand. She's a hard worker, and she'll expect you to be too. But I'm sure you'll get along like a house on fire! Or, even better, one that isn't on fire. Less shouting that way."
l1_keeperhut_01.txt= "Well, Bernie certainly seems impressed. Did he do his speed camera joke? Tsk, every time we get an ostrich... So, now we've made the Ostriches' lives a bit better, let's do the same for the keepers, shall we? To make it easier for the keepers to feed the ostriches and hippos we should build a new keeper hut. Keeper huts are where the keepers prepare the food for animals. So they should be placed near to the habitats to make sure the keepers don't waste their time walking when they should be looking after the animals."
l1_keeperhut_02.txt= "You'll need to rotate the keeper hut to get it to connect up to the path."
l1_keeperhut_03.txt= "This keeper hut only has space for one keeper but the larger Keeper Hut can allow multiple keepers to prepare food at the same time. Oh, but bear in mind that keeper huts, and other staff facilities, shouldn't be placed near to areas where there are lots of guests. Guests don't like seeing facility buildings and it can affect their happiness. ...Negatively, ha ha ha, in case that wasn't clear."
l1_ostrich_03.txt= "Nice work -  those big feathery fowls look as happy as a clam. You've definitely got a future in this business. Which is good, because I've got something else I could do with your help on. So let's move on from the Bronze objectives to the Silver ones, shall we?"
l1_ostrich_adopt_01.txt= "Alright, you've finished the habitat, so it's high time we adopted those Ostriches, don't you think? Let's get four of them in here."
l1_ostrich_barrier_01.txt= "Right, let's complete the perimeter barrier so we can adopt us some ostriches. I've marked out an area for you to use, so I'd like you to finish off the perimeter using the brick barrier."
l1_ostrich_barrier_02.txt= "Good work! Remember, before you can place animals in any habitat, it has to have a full loop of connected barrier."
l1_ostrich_barrier_03.txt= "Now, you've probably noticed that guests can't actually see into this habitat at the moment. At least, not without a stepladder. But seeing as they're banned, I'd like you to select a piece of barrier and swap out the brick for a glass barrier so the guests can see in."
l1_ostrich_barrier_04.txt= "There we go! Adding in more windows gives guests even more opportunities to see the animals in a habitat. It's always best to make sure the guests can get a good view into a habitat from the path they're walking on, because it makes them happy. And because this would be a pretty terrible zoo if they couldn't."
l1_ostrich_donations_01.txt= "The last thing we need to do is to add a donation box. You see, when guests enjoy the view of an animal they'll make a donation. Just make sure you put them in easy to reach places, like near a viewing point. Donation boxes are one of the main sources of income for the zoo, so make sure you remember them!"
l1_ostrich_gate_01.txt= "Okay, job number one here is to add a keeper gate before we complete the barrier. Every habitat needs a keeper gate - after all, how else would the keepers get in and out? Just make sure it's hooked up to the path so the keepers can reach it."
l1_ostrich_intro_01.txt= "Ooh, nice work. You've got a knack for this, I see. Now, our contractor had to leave in a hurry so this place is in a fair old state. Unfinished thingamajigs and wotsits all over the shop. But the first thing we need to finish is the Ostrich habitat - it's over near the hippos."
l1_ostrich_pause_01.txt= "Oh, before we actually start building our Ostrich habitat let's pause the game. Just click the pause button in the bottom right corner."
l1_ostrich_pause_02.txt= "Ah, that's more like it - a quick break. Sometimes it's a good idea to pause the game while you're doing something which requires your concentration, because it'll stop the zoo spinning out of control while you're looking the other way. Let's keep the game paused while we get this Ostrich habitat built..."
l1_ostrich_pause_03.txt= "Now, before we adopt our Ostriches you should click the play button. After all, if the game's paused, then so are our caretakers, which'll make it a bit tricky for them to deliver the Ostriches, eh?"
l1_ostrich_rename_01.txt= "Let's rename the habitat to something more helpful so that when things go wrong and you get a notification you'll know where to go. Sorry, I meant "if", not "when". Anyway, rename it something memorable, but helpful. I suggest Ostrich, but it's up to you."
l1_ostrich_welfare_01.txt= "While we wait for them to be collected by the caretakers and brought to the habitat, you should get it ready for them. Add a suitable feeding station, water station, and an appropriate food enrichment item."
l1_ostrich_welfare_02.txt= "It's often best to place things like enrichments and feeding stations near to the habitat perimeter so guests can get a really good view of the animals."
l1_overall_welfare_01.txt= "Well then, all of that should give you a pretty good understanding of how to make animals happy, so I'd like you to go check on all the other animals in the zoo and fix up any issues with their habitats. That'll increase the average welfare of the animals across the whole zoo - and that average welfare is a very important statistic."
l1_overall_welfare_02.txt= "Now, to quickly see how all your animals are doing in the zoo you should go into Zoo Management, and then into the animals section."
l1_overall_welfare_03.txt= "As you can see, this list shows you the animals' overall welfare. So, if something's amiss then you can quickly pop over to them using the locate button. Right, I'm off for a cuppa while you make sure all the animals are well looked after!"
l1_paused_01.txt= "The game's currently paused. You'll need to unpause it if you want to continue with the scenario."
l1_paused_02.txt= "You can pause the game by clicking on the pause button in the bottom right. Pausing the game can be useful while you build - that way you can concentrate on the building without having to worry about something going wrong elsewhere."
l1_peafowls_info_01.txt= "Now then, just find one of the peafowls and select them to open their info panel, then we can have a good gander at how they're doing. Although technically I suppose gandering would just be for geese."
l1_peafowls_info_02.txt= "Expand their Social Welfare and we can get a bit more detail..."
l1_peafowls_info_03.txt= "Ah, now, they've clearly got plenty of space and they're not stressed, but it looks like their social group isn't quite right so let's find out more. Click the social tab at the top of their information panel to see what's wrong."
l1_peafowls_info_04.txt= "Right, as you can see the peafowls need their population to be larger. To solve this little problem you'll need to adopt three more female peafowls. Well, off you pop to the Animal Market, then!"
l1_peafowls_locate_01.txt= "Right, let's head over to the Indian peafowls. I've been told that we need to improve their social welfare."
l1_power_01.txt= "Something that all facilities, shops, and a whole host of other objects need is power. And that obviously includes your newly built Keeper Hut, so let's place a transformer next to it, shall we?"
l1_power_02.txt= "Now, the reason everything has gone blue is because you're using the power heat map. This map allows to see what is and what isn't powered in your zoo. So, once you've placed your transformer you can click in the bottom left to turn the heat map off."
l1_power_03.txt= "Lovely work! Now the keepers can start using the hut to prepare food, and thanks to where you've put it they won't need to walk very far to deliver it to the ostriches and hippos."
l1_silver_achieved_01.txt= "They say that good fences make good neighbours. I guess that's doubly true when one of the neighbours is a Bengal tiger. Still, those tigers look so happy that I doubt they'd leave, even if you did poke a hole in their fence."
l1_silver_achieved_02.txt= "Oh, but for heaven's sake don't test that theory..."
l1_silver_close_01.txt= "Look at that - the tigers are even happier than clams! You're just tearing through these jobs, aren't you? Right, well those were all the Silver objectives. That just leaves the Gold ones…"
l1_snowleopards_bedding_01.txt= "Another way that animals are like us is that they love somewhere comfy to sleep. So go ahead and add some bedding to the Snow Leopard's habitat - preferably in their shelter. Animals won't use bedding if it gets wet."
l1_snowleopards_stress_01.txt= "Just like people, animals can suffer from stress if things aren't quite right. You know, like when you see someone put in the milk before the teabag. In the case of these Snow Leopards, they're a bit stressed by their lack of privacy."
l1_snowleopards_stress_02.txt= "You can lower their stress levels by swapping out the normal glass barrier by their cave for one-way glass. It's not a cheap option but I think they're worth the expense, don't you? This will give the Snow Leopard somewhere to go when they want to get away from the prying eyes of the guests."
l1_snowleopards_stress_03.txt= "Another good way to reduce stress is to place some cover down for the animals where they can go and hide. One-way glass is good, but it is rather expensive..."
l1_snowleopards_temperature_01.txt= "Of course, when an animal isn't in its natural biome it's probably going to be too hot or too cold. Unsurprisingly, for the Snow Leopards it's too hot. Even with the terrible British weather. You should help cool it down by adding some coolers to their habitat, but let's start by opening up the temperature heat map and having a look-see at the temperature in the leopard's habitat."
l1_snowleopards_temperature_02.txt= "As you can see we already have one cooler in there. Let's pop some more down and get as much of the habitat as chilly as we can. Luckily for us, this habitat already has power, but you'll need to make sure of that in the future. Just so you know, if any part of a habitat is powered then the whole habitat will be powered."
l1_snowleopards_temperature_03.txt= "You can find heat maps for all sort of helpful things, so do be sure to explore them and make good use of them."
l1_snowleopards_terrain_01.txt= "It'll take a little while for the temperature to adjust once you've added coolers or heaters, but now we've got the coolers in we can address the leopard's terrain welfare. You see, what the leopards really want in here is snow and rock, so let's make that happen."
l1_snowleopard_locate_01.txt= "Good work on those peafowls! I expect they'll be delivered soon, but sadly it sounds like our Snow Leopard is a bit grumpy - let's head over there and see what's wrong with her."
l1_warthogs_01.txt= "As you can see, it's a lovely space for animals but it's missing a certain something. Well, two somethings - warthogs! So I'd like you to adopt a pair of them. To adopt animals we need to open the Animal Market, which is in the Animal Trading section."
l1_warthogs_02.txt= "There we are, a pair of perfectly splendid warthogs for our zoo. Just click on them and select 'Adopt' from the side menu. Normally the animal exchange would be full of animals but I've emptied out the market while you learn how it works - the last thing I need is you accidentally ordering a dozen elephants!"
l1_warthogs_03.txt= "When you adopt an animal, it's automatically placed in Animal Storage, where they're held until you're ready to move them into their habitat. Which - as it happens - you are, so how about you move them into their new home?"
l1_warthogs_enrichment_01.txt= "Animals also require stimulation to keep them happy. Let's add a lovely mud bath for the warthogs to roll around in. That bath will count towards their enrichment welfare, specifically their toy enrichment welfare."
l1_warthogs_placement_01.txt= "Click inside the habitat to send them there. And make sure you send both of them!"
l1_warthogs_quarantine_01.txt= "Of course, normally we'd have to place animals into quarantine before moving them into a habitat, but I am assured by a person of good standing that these warthogs are in the very rudest of health."
l1_warthogs_tradecentre_01.txt= "When you ask for an animal to be moved into a habitat your caretakers will go to the Trade Centre, collect your animal and deliver them to your selected habitat. I've marked the Trade Centre's location so let's go and watch the caretakers in action."
l1_warthogs_tradecentre_02.txt= "Well, as you can see, those caretakers don't hang about - they'll move those animals to their destination as fast as possible!"
l1_warthogs_welfare_01.txt= "Right, let's get the warthogs' habitat finished up so we can keep them nice and happy. You see, each animal in the zoo has an overall welfare statistic - basically how happy they are. And that overall welfare statistic is itself comprised of four different areas: Nutrition, Social Health, Habitat and Enrichment."
l1_warthogs_welfare_02.txt= "Luckily, if you select an animal, you'll bring up their Animal Welfare information panel, which we saw earlier, where you can see how they're doing, that way you'll know exactly what areas need to be addressed. Don't worry if that's a lot to remember, you can always check the Zoopedia for more information."
l1_warthogs_welfare_03.txt= "Let's start by making sure we're taking care of the Warthogs' Nutrition Welfare. To do this we'll need to place a food station and a drinking station. Now, each animal requires a different type of feeding station, and for the Warthogs it's a small feeding trough. So let's add one of those and a water bowl."
l1_welcome_01.txt= "Hello there. From that rosy fresh face of yours, I'm guessing you're Bernie's new hire? Good. Now, I hope you're ready to ditch your diploma because we're about to get really hands-on..."

l2_bonobos_escape_02.txt= "And wouldn't you know it, one of the bonobos has made a run for it! We'll need to catch them, but before we do, we should box up the other bonobos to stop them escaping, too. Select the habitat boundary to bring up the habitat information panel."
l2_bonobos_habitat_01.txt= "Good, now open the animals tabs."
l2_bonobos_habitat_02.txt= "And click on Box All Animals to box up the remaining bonobos."
l2_bonobos_intro_01.txt= "When you're ready, let's go and have a looksie at some of our beautiful bonobos. They're quite the characters!"
l2_bonobos_locate_escape_01.txt= "Great, now let's deal with our escapee before they can cause too much havoc! Use the Animal Alerts to jump to the escaped bonobo."
l2_bonobos_locate_escape_02.txt= "Click on the bonobo to bring up its information panel."

l2_bonobo_barrier_01.txt= "As you can see, the barrier's collapsed. Someone's taken their eye off the ball, obviously. Let's get this one replaced."
l2_bonobo_barrier_02.txt= "Select the barrier and then we'll edit it."
l2_bonobo_barrier_03.txt= "Delete the broken section of barrier and replace it with a brand spanking new one."
l2_bonobo_climb_proof_01.txt= "Good! Now that we've done that, we need to make sure to add climb-proof barriers to the top. That way, the Bonobos won't be able to climb out. Just make sure you've got the correct piece of barrier selected when you do that."
l2_bonobo_climb_proof_02.txt= "Okay, so go into the options section and select which side the climb-proof barrier needs to go on. And don't get it wrong. We're more worried about bonobos climbing out than guests climbing in!"
l2_bonobo_habitat_01.txt= "Okay, that's a relief. So, while the vet deals with our bonobo friend, let's go fix up their habitat so they can't escape again. Head back over there."
l2_bonobo_release_01.txt= "To release Agung we'll first have to send him to Animal Storage - you can do that by clicking the button at the bottom of his information panel."
l2_bonobo_release_01b.txt= "Now, open up Animal Storage - you'll find that in the Animal Trading section."
l2_bonobo_release_01c.txt= "And finally, just select Agung from the list and then click Release to the Wild."
l2_bonobo_release_02.txt= "I know it's sad to see him go, but he'll be happy out in the wild. And he's a wonderful candidate for release; young, strong and fertile."
l2_bonobo_unbox_01.txt= "Nicely done. And I think it's high time we unboxed those bonobos, wouldn't you say? The poor mites'll get sad if we leave them in there for too long."

l2_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "I hear you had a bit of an issue with an escaped bonobo. The main thing is that you dealt with it swiftly. And more importantly, without the animal stealing someone's clothes, putting them on and then walking out of the front gate."
l2_bronze_complete_01.txt= "Gosh, we have been busy, haven't we? Good work, there. I'm off for a cuppa - ooh, I think Bernie wants a word with you..."
l2_build_exhibit_01.txt= "OK, so far we've done a lot of work with Habitat Animals but now it's time to learn all about Exhibit animals. Let's build a brand new exhibit!"

l2_build_exhibit_03.txt= "Lovely, now let's build a new Exhibit in the gap that's been left. Just add it to the building like we did with the Research Centre earlier, then pop it into the gap."
l2_education_01.txt= "Ah, from the looks of it, the zoo's old vet has already done some research into Ring Tailed Lemurs - wonderful!"
l2_education_02.txt= "That means that the next piece of research that the vet will do on Ring Tailed Lemurs will unlock a guest education boost for them. Unlocking that will make any Education Boards, Speakers or Audio Guides you have for the lemurs even more effective at teaching our guests all about these wonderfully cheeky creatures."
l2_exhibit_education_01.txt= "There's also an exhibit Education Board. Pop them down near your exhibits to teach your guests about them. Let's add one now."

l2_gold_achieved_01.txt= "Well, you've certainly transformed the zoo - I barely recognise it! A wonderful new exhibit...some fascinating new species...and you've done wonders for the animals' welfare by enriching their habitats. Who doesn't love playing with a three-foot-wide soccer ball, eh? I mean, other than professional soccer players."
l2_gold_achieved_02.txt= "I'm sure it wasn't easy, though - I expect money was tighter than a possum's pouch.

l2_increase_species_01.txt= "Right, now, I've got a bit of a big job for you. I need you to increase the number of species in the zoo.

I'll check in with you when you're almost done."

l2_increase_welfare_01.txt= "My my, you have been busy, haven't you? Splendid! But now that you've adopted all those lovely new species, we need to make sure they're nice and happy. So, lets get the average welfare across the zoo nice and high, shall we? And by we, I mean you. Go on, get to it!"
l2_increase_welfare_02.txt= "Now that your animals are feeling contented, let's try and keep them that way for three months, is it?

l2_intro_01.txt= "Welcome to Madagascar – it's quite the change of scenery from dreary old England, eh? Apart from the weather, I suppose - they don't call these places rainforests for nothing."
l2_intro_02.txt= "The zoo you'll be working in is an Ape Sanctuary where we're doing vitally important conservation work. Not just for apes, but for all kinds of species. But apes...well, apes are some of the closest relatives to humans there are, and yet the way the world treats them is like...well, very much like some of us treat our actual relatives."
l2_intro_03.txt= "Anyway, that's why I'm determined that our operation here does some good. If we can all leave some part of the world in a better state than we found it, we'll have lived lives worth living."
l2_intro_04.txt= "And speaking of states - I've a horrible feeling I left the house in a right one. When I get back I expect my life won't be worth living at all..."

l2_redruffedlemur_01.txt= "Red Ruffed Lemurs are found in the rainforests of Masoala - that's in in North East Madagascar. They can actually live anywhere from fifteen up to twenty-five years. Fancy that, eh? Okay, when you're ready, let's go find our Bornean Orangutans."
l2_release_info_01.txt= "Ah, right then, now that we've dealt with the mechanics, let's go back to our vet - we've got some more work for them..."
l2_release_info_02.txt= "You see, when we feel an animal is ready we can release them into the wild. But, what makes an animal a good candidate for release? Well, their age is an important factor - I mean we can't release an animal that's a juvenile, just as we can't release one that's gotten too old."
l2_release_info_03.txt= "They'll also need to be fertile. After all, the idea is to repopulate the wild, so the best candidates will have a high fertility gene. And together, the age and fertility of a candidate will determine how many Conservation Credits we'll be rewarded when we release them."
l2_release_info_04.txt= "Now, Conservation Credits are vitally important - they're the life blood of your zoo, because earning them allows you to adopt even more animals, and what's more the animals you can adopt will be of a higher quality."
l2_release_info_05.txt= "So, with that in mind, let's pop over to our orangutan habitat."
l2_research_addtobuilding_01.txt= "If you select the Research Centre for placement and then hover over the shell, you'll see that it asks if you want to add the Research Centre to the existing building."

l2_research_building_01.txt= "You see, another key responsibility for our vets is animal research. Researching animals allows vets to unlock new enrichment items, additional information for our education resources, enhanced breeding programmes and improvements to food quality. Oh, the animal's food, not the vet's - it'll take more than a research grant to improve the staff canteen... Anyway, as you can see, research is a key part of running your zoo!"
l2_research_building_02.txt= "In order for a vet to undertake research they require a Research Centre. And, once again, that's something that this zoo is missing, so let's build one. I've marked out an area for you to put it."
l2_research_complete_01.txt= "Ooh, it looks as though our vet has completed their research on Ring Tailed Lemurs - we'll need to collect the results. We can do that by clicking on the notification or by going back into the Vet Research area."
l2_research_complete_01_alt.txt= "Ooh, it looks as though our vet has already completed their research on Ring Tailed Lemurs - that was fast! It normally takes them much longer - the previous vet must have almost finished it beforehand... We'd better go collect the results. We can do that by clicking on the notification or by going back into the Vet Research area."
l2_research_complete_02.txt= "Go on, collect your research rewards!"
l2_research_complete_03.txt= "Just so you know, vets will continue to research an animal even after successfully completing a research level. I suppose when you're in the zone, you're in the zone!"
l2_research_heaight_01.txt= "And you'll need to alter the height until it's level with the path - after all, they're vets - not mountaineers!"
l2_research_placement_01.txt= "Now, you've probably noticed that there's already a building where I want you to build the Research Centre. Don't worry, you see the building that's currently there is actually a hollow shell, so we're able to place our new building inside of it."
l2_research_place_01.txt= "Lovely. Now, when you're all set, just click to place it."
l2_research_rotate_01.txt= "First, we need to rotate our Research Centre so it automatically connects to the path when we place it."
l2_ringtailed_assign_01.txt= "OK, now that they've been put into position, we have to tell them what animal to display information about. Select one of the Education Boards to bring up its information panel."
l2_ringtailed_assign_02.txt= "And from the drop down list, select Ring Tailed Lemur. Although I'm sure that last part was obvious."
l2_ringtailed_assign_03.txt= "When you link an Education Board or a Speaker to an animal, you need to make sure that said animal is close by. If it isn't, the guests'll get confused and won't learn as much."
l2_ringtailed_boards_01.txt= "First off, let's pop down two Education Boards. Place them on the habitat barriers at a height that guests can see, or - if you like - pop them down on a stand."
l2_ringtailed_climbing_01.txt= "Well, now that we've enriched the lives of our guests, let's enrich the lives of our Ring Tailed Lemurs."
l2_ringtailed_climbing_02.txt= "Some animals, like lemurs, will have a Climbing Need - that means they have a requirement for a certain amount of climbing space. And you can fulfil that requirement by building them a climbing frame."
l2_ringtailed_complete_01.txt= "Fantastic! Oh, it's worth remembering that Education Boards and Speakers both need power to work. They won't do much good without it!"
l2_ringtailed_foodquality_01.txt= "Oh, that's a great climbing frame for them! They're going to absolutely love it! D'you know what would make them even happier, though? Nicer food! But that's true of all of us though, isn't it?"
l2_ringtailed_foodquality_02.txt= "You can unlock better quality food for animals through research. Luckily, we've already unlocked some for the lemurs, so all that remains is to make sure they get served it from now on."
l2_ringtailed_foodquality_03.txt= "Let's bring up the habitat information panel by selecting the lemur habitat."
l2_ringtailed_foodquality_04.txt= "Lovely. Now select the Animals tab."
l2_ringtailed_foodquality_05.txt= "And then expand the Habitats Contents."
l2_ringtailed_foodquality_06.txt= "There we go! As you can see, we can set the food quality in here. Just click on the drop down menu and select Grade 2 Food Quality. Mmm... "Grade 2 Food Quality" - my mouth's already watering..."
l2_ringtailed_foodquality_07.txt= "So, a new climbing frame AND better food?! Ooh, you've really spoilt those lemurs rotten. Now, I think it's time we looked at one of the zoo's most important responsibilities - releasing animals into the wild."
l2_ringtailed_frame_01.txt= "Ah, now, as you can see the lemurs need quite a lot more climbing space. But as it happens, I've already got a climbing frame blueprint built for you. So, you can either pop that down or build one yourself from scratch."
l2_ringtailed_frame_02.txt= "By the way, it's not always just climbing needs that you have to worry about. Other animals might need a certain amount of water in their habitat, so they can go for a swim. They certainly do keep us on our toes..."
l2_ringtailed_frame_03.txt= "Oh, that's a great climbing frame for them! They're going to absolutely love it! Now, I think it's time we looked at one of the zoo's most important responsibilities - releasing animals into the wild."
l2_ringtailed_locate_01.txt= "Actually, thinking about it - I'm not sure we've got any Education Boards or Speakers by the lemurs' habitat... Let's head over there and add some so our guests can learn all about about the furry little delights."
l2_ringtailed_selectlemur_01.txt= "Let's find out how much more climbing space our lemur friends need, shall we? Select one of them and bring up their information panel."
l2_ringtailed_selectlemur_02.txt= "Next, click on the Terrain Tab."
l2_ringtailed_speaker_01.txt= "OK, now that we've done the Education Boards, let's pop down a pair of Speakers. Speakers play audio to the guests so they can learn while they look at the animals, instead of having to go through the laborious process of reading."
l2_ringtailed_speaker_02.txt= "One thing to bear in mind is that it's important not to put the Speakers too close together. If you do, the guests won't be able to understand what's being said!"
l2_ringtailed_speaker_assign_01.txt= "Now we simply need to link the Speakers to the Ring Tailed Lemurs - just like you did with the Education Boards."
l2_silver_achieved_01.txt= "I see you've been doing some homework. Although, it hardly seems like work when you're learning about something as adorable as a Ring Tailed Lemur. I imagine I would have got much better grades at school if there'd been less algebra and more aldabra...tortoises."
l2_silver_complete_01.txt= "Excellent work, there. You've definitely got potential, you know!"

l2_tarantula_enrichment_02.txt= "Good, now click on the Layout tab."
l2_tarantula_enrichment_03.txt= "Oh, well it looks like we've only got the Enrichment Level 1 items unlocked at the moment. Never mind, let's turn on at least one of them for the Gila monster."
l2_tarantula_enrichment_04.txt= "As I'm sure you know by now, you can unlock more Enrichment Levels by having one of your vets do some research."
l2_tarantula_windows_01.txt= "That's the ticket! And the last thing we need to look at is setting up the different windows. So click on the Windows tab."
l2_tarantula_windows_02.txt= "You can edit and customise any of the windows on an exhibit. A window can be closed and blank, or have a two-dimensional background or even a three-dimensional background on it. Why don't you have a play around with the options?"
l2_vet_research_01.txt= "Right, splendid work. Now that we have a brand spanking new Research Centre, we can give our vet something to do in there!"
l2_vet_research_02.txt= "Oh, by the way, it's worth noting that the vets will only do research when they're not required to do any other jobs. That said, you can change what tasks a vet does via their information panel, but let's not worry about that just now."
l2_vet_research_assign_01.txt= "So, let's get our vet researching Ring Tailed Lemurs."
l2_vet_research_assign_02.txt= "Go into the Zoo section and select Vet Research."
l2_vet_research_assign_03.txt= "Here you can see a list of all the animals present in your zoo and also all the potential diseases that can occur."
l2_vet_research_assign_04.txt= "Now, drag and drop your vet onto the Ring Tailed Lemur to start their research."
l2_vet_research_detail_01.txt= "Click on the Ring Tailed Lemur in the menu and we'll be able to see a breakdown of precisely what research will be done on them."
l2_vet_research_disease_01.txt= "Just so you know, if a vet researches a disease, it'll help reduce the impact that disease has on any animal which contracts it. Time and effort well spent, if you ask me."
l2_welcome_01.txt= "What d'you think of Madagascar, then? Bit warm for my tastes, to be honest. Anyway, this is Bernie's Primate Sanctuary. It's not just primates, though - we've got all sorts of animals. So why don't we go and have a look at some of them, eh?"
l2_welcome_02.txt= "We'll start by taking a look at the Red Ruffed Lemurs - they're the ones that look like they should be in a Shakespeare play. Come on, let's head over to them."
l3_animal_welfare_01.txt= "I'm sure you know by now how to make your animals happy. So, you'd best get that sorted before the inspector gets here. Sorry, did I not mention there was an inspector coming? Oh dear..."

l3_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "That was a close run thing with those antelopes! I dread to think what might have happened if you hadn't got them into quarantine as quickly as you did - fast thinking there!

l3_bronze_close_01.txt= "Lovely job! Once that research is complete, I expect we'll send that disease packing in no time!"
l3_disease_research_01.txt= "Now, I'll be honest, I'm still a little worried about that disease scare we had, so I think we should do some research into it. Doing research into a disease can help prevent future outbreaks of it, and even if we do have an outbreak, it'll make the disease much less potent."
l3_disease_research_02.txt= "I'd like you to start some research into Bordetellosis. Disease Research can be found in Vet Research, so head over to your Research Centre and get one of the vets researching it."
l3_gharials_locate_01.txt= "Now, if you can tear yourself away, let's go and have a looksie at the gharials..."
l3_gharials_locate_02.txt= "I know that gharials might look a bit scary, but unless you're a fish you've got nothing to worry about! Reason being, those long snouts really aren't suited to tackling large animals. You can even keep them in the same habitats as wildebeests, antelopes and elephants!"
l3_gold_achieved_01.txt= "I've been told that there are smiles on the faces of all of the guests - that's a real testament to the hard work you've put into this place. And if anything, I hear the animals look even happier! Although in all honesty it's hard to tell with the Pandas - they're so enigmatic..."
l3_gold_achieved_02.txt= "I'm told that Lin Lin's quite the character, though. She's really been a hit with the visitors! You could even say that business is bam-booming!"

l3_gold_achieved_04.txt= "I shouldn't be surprised, though - after all you've become a very capable trainee zoo-manager. I suspect there isn't a single task I could throw at you which you wouldn't handle with aplomb. That said, I think the next one's going to be a bit of a curveball..."
l3_gold_close_01.txt= "Goodness - you know, I really can't believe just how much you've come on during our time together. It goes to show - Bernie's got a keen eye for talent! Oh, and speaking of Bernie, he's not finished with you yet - he's got a new job for you in Canada! I get the feeling that you'd best pack a warm coat. Aw, listen, it's been wonderful getting to know you, and I'm sure we'll meet again, but in the meantime...good luck!"
l3_guest_happiness_01.txt= "Oh, well it seems that with our new Pandas and other species we've attracted lots and lots of new guests! Let's work on making sure those guests are kept happy. That means making sure they have great views of the animals, lots of places to buy food and drink and - well - lots of places to get rid of food and drink - toilets!"
l3_guest_happiness_01b.txt= "You should think carefully about where you put your guest facilities, though. For instance, don't put all of the food shops in the same place. Just look at the how the guests are distributed around the park, and put your facilities where they'll be needed the most."

l3_mechanic_research_04.txt= "Great stuff! That research will take a little while, so let's have a look at something else in the meantime, because we've had some good news!"
l3_pandas_adopt_01.txt= "It turns out that we're allowed to adopt more Giant Pandas. The authorities have given us three females to help with our breeding program. Even so, I'm sure you know how notoriously difficult it is to get Pandas to breed, so we'll have to be patient."
l3_pandas_adopt_02.txt= "Our current Giant Panda habitat is full to the brim, but luckily we've already got another habitat ready to go. But before we move our new Pandas in, they'll need to go through quarantine. Of course, we can't do that until we've accepted them! So open up Animal Trading and go into the Animal Reward Section."
l3_pandas_adopt_03.txt= "Just click 'Transfer to Animal Storage' next to each of the Pandas and then they'll be sent there"
l3_pandas_adopt_04.txt= "Finally we can send them from Animal Storage to Quarantine. To do that just select them in Animal Storage, then click Send to Zoo and then click on the Quarantine facility in the zoo. Don't worry - I've highlighted it for you so you can find it easily."
l3_pandas_adopt_05.txt= "While we wait for them to clear quarantine, you should set up their new habitat so they feel at home in there. I'll also need you to bring over one of the male Pandas from our other habitat because without him, we're not going to have much of a breeding programme, are we? So, go on, move him over and get everything set up for your Pandas!"
l3_pandas_adopt_06.txt= "Good news - our new female Pandas have been given a clean bill of health! You'd best move them into the new habitat so they can settle in. And I hope you've made their habitat as comfy as possible because animals will only breed if they're happy."
l3_pandas_adopt_07.txt= "Aw, bless - they do look happy in there, don't they? Fingers crossed we'll see some lovely new cubs sooner rather than later."
l3_pandas_adopt_07_alt.txt= "Aw, bless - I think they'll be really happy in there, fingers crossed we'll see some lovely new cubs sooner rather than later. Right, while they're being delivered we'd better get on with something else, eh? Dear me,  there's never any time to rest when you're running a zoo, is there? Well, unless you hit the pause button."
l3_pandas_locate_01.txt= "Obviously the Giant Pandas are the main attraction for this zoo and, luckily for us, we have one which was born just a few days ago. Let's go and have a look at it."
l3_pandas_locate_02.txt= "Go on, don't be shy - select the Panda cub."
l3_pandas_locate_03.txt= "And click on the camera to enter Animal Camera mode."
l3_pandas_locate_04.txt= "Aw... Doesn't it just warm the cockles of your heart? So cute... Did you know that Giant Pandas - or Ailuropoda melanoleuca, if we're being formal - are the only entirely herbivorous bears? They can actually eat up to thirty-eight kilos of bamboo a day! Not that surprising given that they'll spend up to fourteen hours a day chomping away. I don't imagine this little fluff ball has that kind of appetite yet, though."
l3_pangolins_locate_01.txt= "Right, I think we should go and visit the pangolins next..."
l3_pangolins_locate_04.txt= "Ah, pangolins are very interesting creatures, you know. They're the only mammal with scales - if you exclude humans and bathroom ones. If a pangolin feels threatened, they'll roll up into a ball and use those tough scales to protect themselves."
l3_quarantine_01.txt= "Oh no, I just got word from one of our keepers that a sable antelope was placed into a habitat without going through quarantine first, and that they're displaying signs of disease! We'll have to move them into quarantine to stop the infection from spreading to the other animals. To do that, go to the highlighted habitat, find the infected animal and then select them to bring up their information panel."
l3_quarantine_02.txt= "Good, now click Move and then transfer them into quarantine, I've highlighted the quarantine facility in the zoo for you."
l3_shop_01.txt= "Ooh, it sounds like the Brand Research has been completed! You should collect your rewards, and you can do that by clicking on the notification or by going back into the Mechanic Research."
l3_shop_02.txt= "Now that we've got our lovely new Just A Momento shop designed, you should build one of them near the zoo's exit - that way the guests won't miss it on their way out, and we won't miss out on their money!"
l3_silver_achieved_01.txt= "Those Pandas look just adorable! I can see why people keep foolishly forgetting that they're wild bears."
l3_silver_achieved_02.txt= "And good work on that new gift shop branding - 'Just A Momento'  - very clever! Much better than our old 'Overpriced Gifts' branding. I'm all for truth in advertising, but it was perhaps a little on-the-nose..."
l3_silver_close_01.txt= "Oh, that's ever so wonderful, that is. Anyway, I'm just off for a moment, but I'm sure I'll have some more jobs for you to look at shortly..."
l3_species_increase_01.txt= "Back as promised. Right, I'd like you to increase the number of different species in the zoo. Now, you can find out what species are already in your zoo by going into the Zoo section and then into the Animals area. And if you're wondering how you're going to fit them all in, then mixed species habitats are a great way to save space and create interesting habitats."
l3_species_increase_01b.txt= "Just make sure to check the Zoopedia to find out which species enjoy living together. i.e. Don't mix lions with antelopes!"
l3_species_increase_02.txt= "I'm not going to micro-manage you while you do this because you've already proven that you've got a sound head on your shoulders. I will pop back when you're almost done, though. Provided I've finished off my tea and bara brith, obviously..."
l3_species_increase_03.txt= "You've been quite productive I see - good work! A couple more species and I think that'll do nicely, won't it?"
l3_species_increase_04.txt= "Ooh, just one more to go and you'll be done."
l3_species_increase_05.txt= "Look at that - you've really managed to get a nice mix of species, haven't you? I wasn't sure there'd be space, to be honest..."
l3_vet_surgery_01.txt= "Phew, that's a relief. Now that we've stopped the infection from spreading any further, we need to build a vet surgery so the antelope can be treated and then returned to his habitat. I've already highlighted where I'd like you to build it, so why don't we head over there?"
l3_vet_surgery_02.txt= "In order to build the vet surgery, click on Facilities, Staff Facilities and then Vet Surgeries."
l3_vet_surgery_03.txt= "That's the job! Vet surgeries play a very important role in a zoo, as they're the only places that vets can treat the animals. Once there's room for the antelope, the vet will pick them up from quarantine and bring them to the surgery."
l3_water_treatment_01.txt= "Hmm, yes - diseases can spread through a habitat quite easily, especially if the water inside it isn't being cleaned regularly. As it happens, I just got a report that one of our water treatment facilities has broken down and the water in the flamingo and saltwater crocodile habitats has gotten dirty. I've highlighted the water treatment facility for you, so you should go and check it out."
l3_water_treatment_02.txt= "Good work! Now that the water treatment facility has been repaired the water will be cleaned up in two shakes of a lamb's tail. You can also use mechanics to repair power facilities, transport rides, bins, benches, signs and - as you already know - habitat barriers."
l3_water_treatment_03.txt= "Click on the Water Treatment Facility to bring up its information panel."
l3_water_treatment_04.txt= "Yes, I don't think you need a degree in mechanics to tell that this thing's thoroughly banjaxed. Click Call Mechanic to get them to come over and fix it for us."
l3_water_treatment_05.txt= "So, just to explain, Water Treatment Facilities work in similar manner to Power Sources in that they have a radius of influence around them. That means any body of water which is even partly within that radius will be cleaned automatically. Also like power sources, if they get damaged that radius of influence will shrink, meaning that it might stop cleaning water sources which were only just within its reach."
l3_water_treatment_06.txt= "If you want to check how much of your zoo is covered by your Water Treatment Facilities then there's a Heat Map you can use to see the coverage, that way you can quickly spot problem areas and rectify the issue."
l3_welcome_01.txt= "Welcome to China. This is Bernie's brand new Panda celebration zoo. So new, in fact, that it's not quite finished - but we'll deal with that later. First, let's take a tour of the zoo."
l3_workzone_01.txt= "So, let's start by creating a new Work Zone, and then assigning a keeper to it so they know to look after the new pandas. To do that, go into the Zoo section, then click on Staff and then Work Zones."
l3_workzone_02.txt= "To set up your new Work Zone I'll need you to select the highlighted habitat gate, staff room and keeper hut. Oh, and don't forget to name it something useful! Once you're done just go ahead and exit the Work Zone creator."
l3_workzone_02b.txt= "Now, click on New Work Zone."
l3_workzone_02c.txt= "That's it - you're now in the Work Zone creator mode."
l3_workzone_03.txt= "Now, let's hire a new keeper and assign them to our new Work Zone. We don't want them getting distracted by other goings-on in the zoo. Go on, hire one."
l3_workzone_04.txt= "Then click on your new keeper to bring up their information panel and go to their Employment tab."
l3_workzone_04b.txt= "At the bottom you can assign them to your new Work Zone from the drop down menu."
l3_workzone_05.txt= "There you go! Now your keeper will focus their attention on our new pandas. Oh, and just so you know, all types of staff can be assigned Work Zones - just make sure that they have access to all the buildings that they need. And one last thing, you might find it faster to assign them from the Work Zones tab in the Staff section of Zoo Management. That'll save you having to chase around selecting your staff one by one."
l3_workzone_intro_01.txt= "Okay, I think it's time I taught you all about Work Zones. I know, they don't sound as interesting as the animals, but trust me - they're ever so useful. You see, Work Zones are a way of making sure that your staff concentrate on specific habitats or tasks within the zoo, so they aren't wandering off elsewhere when it's time to feed the animals or the like."
l4_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "Looks like we already have a zoo, don't we? That was fast!"
l4_bronze_achieved_02.txt= "You're doing me proud, you know. I'll be honest, when I first pictured entrusting someone else to build a zoo, I always imagined it'd be my child doing it. I guess it wasn't to be..."
l4_bronze_achieved_03.txt= "Unless... I don't suppose you're open to being adopted, are you...?"
l4_feedback_animal_welfare.txt= "I've been looking at the reports and your animal welfare rating is off the charts! Literally - I think the office printer's got the wrong page-size set on it... Anyway - keep up the good work!"
l4_feedback_habitatspecies_01.txt= "I hear you're already cracking on with the animal adoption, that's the ticket! Once you've adopted a few more habitat species we'll be sitting pretty!"
l4_feedback_habitatspecies_02.txt= "So there's just the one more habitat species to adopt, eh? Wonderful work!"
l4_gold_achieved_01.txt= "When I tasked you with building a zoo, I gave you some pretty ambitious targets to hit. But wouldn't you know it, you hit them all anyway. I think it's high time we dropped that "Apprentice" from your title, eh?"
l4_gold_achieved_02.txt= "And to be candid, I'm particularly glad you hit the profit target, as I paid way over the odds for the land. Frankly, the amount I spent per square foot, you'd think I'd bought a penthouse apartment with solid gold toilets."
l4_gold_achieved_03.txt= "It was worth it, though. Anything to stop the land going to that dreadful hedge fund, apparently they wanted to parcel it up and sell it off to various mining and energy consortiums. They're the sort of people who'd squeeze the oil out of the Mona Lisa if they could..."
l4_intro_01.txt= "After your sterling work in China, I've got a bit of a "good news, better news" situation for you."
l4_intro_02.txt= "The good news is that I'm promoting you to Apprentice Zoo Manager! The better news is you get to build a new zoo from scratch! That said, you will be on your own this time - no help from Nancy, although she wishes you luck. So, I suppose it's actually more of a "good news, better news and then slightly worse news" situation. Either way, it's a chance for you to really prove yourself!"
l4_intro_03.txt= "Now, for this zoo, I'll want to see a good few different habitat and exhibit species, and at least as many guests to look at them. I'd also like you to keep your staff nice and happy as much as you can, and obviously the same's true of the animals as well. Oh, and, let's see...yes. You should try to turn a good sized profit to boot - so we can continue our vital work elsewhere. There, that should keep you going for a while."
l4_intro_04.txt= "I'll check in with you later - good luck!"
l4_post-bronze_01.txt= "Oh, almost forgot. Now you've completed your first lot of jobs - or "Bronze objectives" as Nancy likes to say - you can, if you wish, move onto the next zoo."
l4_post-bronze_02.txt= "Obviously, I'd prefer that you stayed on here and took care of the rest of those objectives, but I can certainly understand the desire to keep moving onwards and upwards, just like an escalator. Or a downwards escalator which is going the wrong way."
l4_silver_achieved_01.txt= "I hate to sound jealous, but I'm hearing from the staff there that they prefer working for you over me! I can understand it, though - you've built a fine place for them. I'll have to up my game back here, won't I?"
l4_silver_achieved_02.txt= "In fact, it's settled - I'm buying all my staff Cosmic Cow ice cream!"
l5_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "Nice. That Safari ride is proving very popular with the guests - you're really giving them a taste of Africa's wildlife. And, when the wind pleases, often a smell, too."
l5_bronze_achieved_02.txt= "Listen, I know there's lots more work to do here, but once you've finished, your next project will be something really challenging. Partly because I won't be around to offer advice - I'm setting up a venture in the arctic which'll take up all of my time. I might even get you involved in it one day!"
l5_feedback_animal_breeding_01.txt= "Only one more animal birth and we'll have hit our target! I'd better get looking through some baby-name books to find one we haven't used yet…"
l5_feedback_guest_education_01.txt= "It sounds like you're really getting a handle on the guest education - that's good to hear. But, we can do better - let's stuff so much information into their heads that they practically burst!"
l5_feedback_release_to_wild_01.txt= "I hear you're making first-rate progress with our wild animal release programme! Just a few more releases and we'll be bang on target!"
l5_feedback_release_to_wild_02.txt= "From what I'm hearing, you've only got one more animal release to go - excellent work! Now, I know it's a bit of a wrench when they leave home, so you feel free to cry just as much as you want."
l5_gold_achieved_01.txt= "Once again, you've completely transformed the place! And with those programs in full swing we're going to make a real difference to the wild animal population. I know it's my name above the door so to speak, but this is your legacy, now, too. Except in any legal sense - because believe me, the paperwork is a nightmare."
l5_gold_achieved_02.txt= "So... before I unleash your talents on your next project, I want to give you one last piece of advice if I may - don't just limit your conservation efforts to the zoo. Think of the whole planet. Conserving electricity can be as important as conserving animals. Use public transport. Recycle your rubbish."
l5_gold_achieved_03.txt= "I try to do something hands-on like cleaning up the local countryside at least once a week and it's kept me young at heart. I just wish it could have kept me young at hairline, as well."
l5_gold_achieved_04.txt= "Right, well - the Arctic beckons! See you in a few months!"
l5_intro_01.txt= "I'll get straight to it, shall I?"
l5_intro_02.txt= "This is our Great Caldera Safari Park - it's been quite a small operation until now, but we've just been donated some land and so, like my waistline at Thanksgiving, we're going to expand."
l5_intro_03.txt= "And I think the best way to finance that expansion is by finishing off our four-by-four Adventure Tour Track Ride - it'll be a wonderful way to let people safely see wild animals really up-close. Although if you've ever had a mandrill sit on your windshield during one, sometimes it's a little too up-close...yes..."
l5_intro_04.txt= "But - the main focus of the sanctuary will be breeding and releasing animals of all kinds back into the wild. And as it's a sanctuary, we'll also have to take in animals sometimes."
l5_intro_05.txt= "Does that all sound simple?"
l5_intro_06.txt= "Good - because there's more. We also need to make sure we educate our guests and achieve a very high conservation rating. Well, that's all - off you go!"
l5_silver_achieved_01.txt= "Good to see the breeding and release programs are going from strength to strength, that's the ticket! And I also see you've adopted a number of cheetahs. You're going to have your work cut out keeping them happy - cheetah's rarely prosper."
l5_silver_achieved_02.txt= "Sorry. I've been sitting on that ever since you got them."
l5_silver_achieved_03.txt= "Right, I should get back to packing. Now, where did I put those snow-boots...?"
l6_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "Thank you! It is such a relief not to have the sound of those protesters in my ears all the time! I wouldn't mind so much if they paid to get in... Still, despite those losses, my accountants tell me you've hit the profit forecast. Good news my friend, this month you get paid! Haha!"
l6_feedback_habitat_species_01.txt= "Look at all these new animals you've got! So where are the rest, then?"
l6_feedback_habitat_species_02.txt= "Not Bad! You've only got one more habitat species to go! D'you know what that means? It means you're only slightly behind schedule!"
l6_feedback_research_01.txt= "Isn't it strange how researching animals makes it easier to care for them? I suppose it wasn't a waste of money after all... Plenty more research to go, though, eh? Perhaps you should try shouting at your eggheads more."
l6_gold_achieved_01.txt= "Well, that new Siberian Tiger's rather good, isn't it? I've always been fond of cats. Can't have one, though. I'm not allergic, it's just when people see a wealthy person like myself stroking a cat they assume he's planning world domination. PR nightmare. That's the last thing I need more of... The zoo's looking good, though. Nice big profits. Lots of different animals. Excellent!"
l6_gold_achieved_02.txt= "Oh, and you passed the inspection! Did you bribe the inspector? Ha ha! Although, in all seriousness, if you did I won't be able to reimburse you without a receipt. Ha ha! Got you again!"
l6_gold_achieved_03.txt= "You know, I think you and I are very similar people. We both know how to squeeze a dollar until it bleeds. It's good to have someone with a pragmatic mind like yours on the staff. After all, we've got to keep the animals happy, but we've got to keep the accountants even happier! Especially given all the tax loopholes I make them jump through..."
l6_gold_achieved_04.txt= "Haha! I got you again, didn't I! Honestly, this business is completely above-board."
l6_intro_01.txt= "Ah, there you are. First, let me say how sorry I am that we're meeting in such awful circumstances. I was a great admirer of...Benjamin? Wait, no...Bernard! You may not know this, but we were actually very good friends. That's why it's going to be such an honour to continue his life's work of letting people pay me to see animals."
l6_intro_02.txt= "I can see you're still sad, though. Perhaps this will lift your spirits - I'm making you senior zoo manager! It's a position of great responsibility! Although the same wages."
l6_intro_03.txt= "I've also bought a new zoo which you're going to be in charge of. It's...a bit of a fixer-upper, but it's nothing you can't handle."
l6_intro_04.txt= "All you have to do is make the animals happy, get those annoying protesters to leave, expand the zoo a skosh, adopt a grizzly bear and a Siberian tiger, make sure the zoo is extremely profitable and then just pass a teeny tiny little inspection. Trust me - you'll have more spare time than you know what to do with!"
l6_intro_05.txt= "Oh, and also you have to research some bears or something. I forget the details."
l6_message_01.txt= "Hey there. You'd better sit down for this, I've got some news."
l6_message_02.txt= "A week ago, Bernie went missing in the Arctic. I know - I only just found out. Apparently our illustrious board of governors decided it was best not to tell anyone while the search parties were still out looking for him."
l6_message_03.txt= "But a few days ago they called off the search."
l6_message_04.txt= "And they hadn't found him. So... they had him declared legally dead. Just so they could sell off all of Bernie's zoos...everything...from the aardvarks to the zebras. They didn't even wait for Bernie's daughter Emma to get back from overseas before they cashed in. They offloaded the whole company to a slimy hedge fund manager called Dominic Myers. Mark my words, he only wants the zoos to help buff out his tarnished image. Anyway, I guess he's your new boss now."
l6_message_05.txt= "Not mine, though - he fired me."
l6_message_06.txt= "Good luck. I know you'll do your best. I know you'll protect the animals."
l6_silver_achieved_01.txt= "Well I never! I'm impressed - you're really turning this zoo around, aren't you? I'm not so sure about that grrr-izzly bear, though - it's not nearly as grizzly as I was hoping. Rather a mild temperament, really. Still, the customers seem to like it - we've sold out of those bear plushies in the shop! I'm rather glad about that - they were a bit of a fire risk."
l7_bengal_tiger_gift.txt= "Apparently a Bengal tiger has just come into our possession - rescued, obviously - from, er, poachers? Yeah, yeah, we'll say poachers. It's in a bit of a bad way, but y'know, a tiger's a tiger. Stick it in the zoo, would you?"
l7_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "My-my, you've really turned this place around, too! No - my mistake - I was just facing a different direction the last time I was here."
l7_bronze_achieved_02.txt= "So, did you like those elephants I got you? They looked so sad when they arrived but look how happy they are now...I hope doing that didn't cost too much."
l7_feedback_animal_escapes.txt= "Heavens, I can barely remember the last time you had an animal escape... These days, all the screams sound like they're of joy. Good. Keep it up a bit longer and perhaps the local government will stop breathing down my neck..."
l7_feedback_clean_water.txt= "I see you've made a start on cleaning the water. Maybe you should make a finish on it, too, hmm?"
l7_feedback_power_loss.txt= "Look at you keeping the power on like that! Who's a clever a little electrician? Just a little longer to go..."
l7_gold_achieved_01.txt= "Goodness, this is like a proper zoo now! The power's not turning off every five minutes, it's got clean running water... Honestly, this zoo is better than most of the properties I rent out back in London. Although they do have more animals. Specifically, rats. Yes, these zoos are doing wonders for 'The Myers brand'..."
l7_gold_achieved_02.txt= "Oh, and you'll never guess who visited! You remember Bernard? His daughter - What's-her-name Goodwin! ...Emma! That's it!"
l7_gold_achieved_03.txt= "Sorry I didn't bring her around to meet you - but she was in bit of a hurry. Just a flying visit. But, she was very impressed with everything I have achieved with these zoos! She said they "honoured the memory of her father". Although she also said not to contact her to confirm that."
l7_gold_achieved_04.txt= "Anyway - pack your bags!"
l7_gold_achieved_05.txt= "No, I'm not firing you. Yet. You're going to Brazil!"
l7_intro_01.txt= "So, after you did such sterling work with that last zoo, I've got a reward for you - a trip to India! So you can fix up the mess one of my other zoos has gotten into."
l7_intro_02.txt= "Just to give you a little history, the zoo used to be a casino I had a majority share in but we had to shut it down. Apparently, building a casino so it looks like a temple's in poor taste - who knew?"
l7_intro_03.txt= "Well, I had workers converting the casino grounds into a zoo but they have not done a brilliant job. We keep having power outages which turn our electric fences into regular fences - animals escape, people scream, blah blah blah. Not an ideal situation, so do something to fix it. Especially as I want you to get some Bengal tigers and put them around the old casino building. I'm all for gambling - but not with people's safety. And not just because of the fines."
l7_intro_04.txt= "Plus you need to clean up all the water - it's extremely unpleasant at the moment and will not be good for the animals. I'd really hate for them to get sick...because it might mean hiring more vets. Oh, and I found some elephants down the back of my proverbial sofa, so find somewhere for them, would you? I think I might be able to find some bears back there, too..."
l7_intro_05.txt= "Okay, good - you should probably head off now. Win big for me!"
l7_nile_monitor_gift.txt= "A couple more pet rescues for you - Nile Monitors. Y'know, it's weird, but there's something about cold-blooded reptiles that I find oddly relatable…"
l7_ring_tailed_gift.txt= "We've just got some Ring Tailed Lemurs which were... ooh, let's go with "rescued from someone's house" for these. Go on, find somewhere for them in the zoo."
l7_silver_achieved_01.txt= "Congratulations - the new tiger habitat looks wonderful! And the number of animal escapes are way down - excellent work! I do find that customers are so much happier when they're not running away from an apex predator. Plus, they're more likely to buy things - and isn't that what zoos are all about? Oh, and guess what? I found those bears I was talking about!"
l8_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "Aah... you can really tell you dealt with that toxic waste - the air doesn't taste like batteries any more. Yes, overall, the zoo's definitely beginning to take shape. The customers seem happy and - best of all - almost none of them have developed respiratory problems as result of their visit."
l8_bronze_achieved_02.txt= "Speaking of which, nice work nursing all those poorly animals back to health. It's a good job we rescued them and brought them into the zoo, eh? After all, the last thing we need is people being able to see animals outside the zoo for free!"
l8_bronze_achieved_03.txt= "Oh, and one last thing - now that the zoo is mostly clean, I'm arranging for Lin Lin to visit from the other zoo. It's going to take a little time, though - so don't worry about it yet. Just worry about everything else."
l8_feedback_habitat_species_01.txt= "Just a few more habitat species and you'll be finished! Don't worry - I don't mean that in a bad way. At least, not today I don't."
l8_feedback_habitat_species_02.txt= "One more habitat species to go - come on, chop chop!"
l8_feedback_rehome_01.txt= "Nice to see that some of those... rescued animals have been given a new home. A new home that I can charge people to look at."
l8_feedback_toxic_waste_01.txt= "I see you're making that toxic waste somebody else's problem. Good. That's my favourite type of problem."
l8_feedback_toxic_waste_02.txt= "You got rid of all the toxic waste, eh? Well, I hope you didn't handle it yourself because trust me, your health insurance will not cover you for the side effects..."
l8_gold_achieved_01.txt= "I've must admit, I'm quite relieved - with all that toxic waste around here I was getting quite worried about you...not making enough of a profit for me! I jest, of course! But, you did it - you're a bit of a financial wizard. I should have you do my accounts. And I mean the real ones. Ho ho!"

l8_gold_achieved_03.txt= "But I think Lin Lin should probably go back home soon. This was just a...short holiday for her. Extremely short. Almost as if she was never here. So, if people ask? She was never here."
l8_gold_achieved_04.txt= "She's done her job, though. Show the world you've got a panda and suddenly people who weren't taking your calls are actually calling you. They can open a lot of doors, pandas. Literally - they've sort of got thumbs, you know..."
l8_intro_01.txt= "Welcome to your new zoo! Except it's not actually a zoo yet."
l8_intro_02.txt= "Now, before you start - you might want to clean up the site a bit. There's a teeny tiny chance that there are massive amounts of toxic waste here. Even for a disused quarry, the land was extremely cheap. Oh, and also extremely steep. So I suggest you build a gondola ride to get the customers around. I mean, I say "suggest", but that's actually a direct order."
l8_intro_03.txt= "Also, looking around the area next to the building site, I couldn't help but notice a lot of very poorly animals. I expect they must have gotten... lost. Really, really lost. Especially the snow leopards. How about I arrange for them to be rescued so you can make them healthy? I think it's the right thing to do. After all, normally I'd have to pay for new animals."
l8_intro_04.txt= "Plus, making them healthy again will really impress the inspector who I just remembered is coming."
l8_intro_05.txt= "Alright, off you go!"
l8_post-silver_01.txt= "Oh, I just remembered! Lin Lin just arrived from the other zoo so you'll need to find somewhere for her. This'll be a nice holiday for her, but - for complicated reasons which I won't go into - she's travelling incognito. So don't tell anyone it's actually Lin Lin. Just make up some other name."
l8_post-silver_02.txt= "But...having a panda should really impress the inspector, hmm? So make sure nothing happens to her."
l8_silver_achieved_01.txt= "Ahh, I see guest numbers are on the up. That's good. I'd hate for us not to have enough money to feed all those new animals you adopted. I mean, it's not like I can feed you to them! Hmm...? No. Oh, and hey! That Gondola ride looks pretty good. You had better not have gone over-budget on it..."
l9_bronze_achieved_01.txt= "Ahh, I see you've made room for all those animals I...rescued...from nearby. I don't know about you, but I'm constantly surprised by the types of animals you find just wandering around the Siberian tundra..."
l9_bronze_achieved_02.txt= "Oh, and speaking of the animals, they're looking happy. With all this weather I was worried the giraffe would need a scarf, because that would be prohibitively expensive..."
l9_feedback_cheetah.txt= "Will you look at how adorable that baby cheetah is? We should definitely raise ticket prices accordingly..."
l9_feedback_every_biome_01.txt= "Just a few more habitat species and we'll have one from every biome, I'm told. Nobody's told me exactly what a biome is, though."

l9_feedback_payment_01.txt= "Don't worry, I've taken the special taxes out of the zoo's account for you. I don't want you getting worried about the paperwork. Or asking to see it."
l9_feedback_payment_02.txt= "I'm afraid it's time to pay the special taxes."
l9_feedback_payment_03.txt= "Has it already been another year? Ah well, best get those taxes paid..."

l9_gold_achieved_01.txt= "Will you look at all those different types of animal! I couldn't even tell you what half of them are! I should probably pay more attention to the paperwork..."
l9_gold_achieved_02.txt= "You've done a very good job here. And I know it hasn't been easy - especially after I replaced the company's Health and Safety officers with Health or Safety officers. But, it was all for a good cause, wasn't it?"
l9_gold_achieved_03.txt= "What? The animals? No - my public image! You know, before I got into the zoo business, I had a terrible reputation. It cut off certain avenues... But now? People are falling over themselves to do business with me."
l9_gold_achieved_04.txt= "So trust me when I say that I'm not going to forget the work you've done for me. I could not have run these zoos without your expertise and I promise you, you will always have place in my company."
l9_intro_01.txt= "What do you think about this zoo, eh? It definitely has potential. Not much actual, but lots of potential."
l9_intro_02.txt= "But, good news - I've arranged a deal with a local building supplier, so you can use as many breeze blocks as you'd like to build here. Pretty much nothing else, though."
l9_intro_03.txt= "Oh, and there's a slight legal issue with the staff - you can't fire any of them. Or hire any more. Oh, except vendors. So keep the staff you've got happy or they could be a real problem. Although not as big a problem as the local taxes, which are a very big problem. Long story short, I'm going to have to take mysteriously large yearly payments from the zoo accounts to pay for them."
l9_intro_04.txt= "Anyway, you'd better get started - I want to see all sorts of animals here - giraffes, cheetahs, orangutans, et cetera. You know, furry ones - so we won't have to spend too much keeping them warm..."
l9_intro_05.txt= "Although, you probably will want to give a warm welcome to the reporter who's coming. I know they say there's no such thing as bad publicity, but trust me, if that was true I wouldn't have had to buy all these zoos..."
l9_silver_achieved_01.txt= "Ah, I've heard from the staff that you're making them very happy! That's good, because I dread to think what they'd do to you if they weren't. My best guess? They'd get you a birthday card, but then deliberately get your name wrong in it."
l9_silver_achieved_02.txt= "And well done on turning such a good profit! Although it could be better. So make it better."

scenario_09_message_01.txt= "Hello there, I'm sorry we haven't met before, but I'm Emma Goodwin, Bernie's daughter. Oh, Nancy gave me your details, I do hope that's okay."
scenario_09_message_02.txt= "Well, the reason I'm getting in touch is because of what Dominic Myers is doing to the profession of zoology. i.e. his wholesale destruction of it. That man should have never been allowed to purchase my family's company - his greed, it corrupts everything he touches."
scenario_09_message_03.txt= "Frankly, the only thing he did right was keeping you on - y'see, I've seen how hard you've been working to make the animals as happy as possible in what I imagine are extremely challenging circumstances. But you're only one person at one zoo - and he owns dozens! Uh, of zoos, not people."
scenario_09_message_04.txt= "Still, I do want you to keep working for him. For now. See, I'm setting something up - I just can't give you any details, yet - but when the time is right I sincerely hope you'll come work for me instead.

scenario_10_fired_03.txt= "It's just that I need a scapegoat. Now, this may come as surprise to you, but we did not have as much permission as we needed to move Lin Lin to our Brazilian zoo. People - important people - are unhappy about what we did. And also extremely unhappy that when the inspector came to check on Lin Lin in Panda Park, we'd replaced her with a man in panda suit. When you add that to us replacing all our zebras with repainted pantomime horses, it makes for a bit of a business kerfuffle."
scenario_10_fired_04.txt= "So, people - and remember, these are important people, important people I very much need to do deals with - are not happy. So that means I need somebody to pin the blame on. That somebody is, regrettably, you."

Well, I'm excited to say it has finally come to fruition. As a result, I find myself in need of a zoo manager. And, while I could do it myself, I'll have bigger fish to fry. Let me explain..."
scenario_10_message_05.txt= "Y'see, I plan on constructing a chain of zoos as rivals to those of Mr Myers - zoos where both the welfare of the animals and our planet is of paramount importance. The eventual goal? To drive Mr Myers out of business and rescue the animals he's exploiting! But such a task is not simple - I will need someone like yourself who is qualified to handle the building of the zoos, while I concentrate on the over-arching business."
scenario_10_message_06.txt= "Now, let me be clear, though - we're going to have to start relatively small. Okay? I've had to sell the family home to fund this venture and the purchase of a plot of land in North America was not cheap. Our first zoo's finances will be balanced on a knife's edge."

zoopedia_description_aardvark.txt= "The aardvark (or Orycteropus afer) is a medium-sized insectivore that lives throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. They have pink-grey skin with sparse, coarse hair, large slender ears and an elongated head that ends in a pig-like snout. Males are slightly larger than females, but both sexes are generally between 105 and 130cm long, have a tail between 60 and 70cm, and weigh between 40 and 65kg.<br><br>The aardvark is not endangered, but it is vulnerable in certain areas. They need a large foraging range in the wild to allow them to acquire enough food, so they are affected by land use change like the expansion of farmland and urban areas. Sometimes they are killed by farmers who want to prevent them from digging up their land, and they are also affected by pesticides that kill the insects they feed on. They are protected in national parks and nature reserves."
zoopedia_description_africanbuffalo.txt= "Living throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, the African buffalo (or Syncerus caffer caffer) is the largest member of the cow family – bovids – found in the African wild. They are typically between 1.7 and 3.4m in length, measure 1.0 to 1.7m tall, and are identifiable by their distinctive horns, which are broad, curved and unite in a 'boss' in the centre of their forehead. The dominant male in a herd will often have the largest horns.<br><br>Although the species is not endangered, African buffalo are still threatened by human activity. Illegal trophy hunting is a regular occurrence and their grazing lands are being transformed – either turned into farmland or built on by humans. African buffalo can also contract diseases that are spread by domestic livestock, and are as well vulnerable to drought conditions. They are protected in many areas that are assigned as National Parks and Nature Reserves, while sustainable hunting occurs in legally managed zones."
zoopedia_description_africanelephant.txt= "Native to the savannahs, forests and mountains of Sub Saharan Africa, the African savannah elephant (or Loxodonta africana) is a large, thickset mammal with grey skin and a characteristic trunk used for vocalising, drinking and grasping food. Both sexes of the species have tusks, and both are known for their intelligence and strong social bonds, especially the bond between mothers and their babies. Female herds bond for life and, even if a herd splits up, the females will remember and communicate with family members they may come across later in life.<br><br>It is an endangered species, threatened by poachers of the illegal ivory trade, but also due to the expansion of human life destroying their habitat. Despite conservation efforts the African savannah elephant population is in decline. It's quite common that they are viewed negatively by locals, mostly because they can destroy farmland and it's hard to 'elephant proof' land with sufficient boundaries. Elephants that live in National Parks are now protected from poaching and hunting, and many African countries have introduced humane ways of preventing elephants from damaging farmland. One method is to build a 'beehive fence'; elephants are extremely afraid of bees and will avoid areas containing them."
zoopedia_description_africanwilddog.txt= "African wild dogs (or Lycaon pictus) are also known as African hunting dogs or painted wolves. They live throughout sub-Saharan Africa – the continent has several different populations and five subspecies in total. The dogs are slim and tall in comparison to other canines, with extremely large rounded ears and distinctive colouration. Generally they have yellow and black mottled fur with white patches on their legs, chest and tail, however this varies on the subspecies. Some may also have a spot-like patterning on parts of their body.<br><br>African wild dogs are endangered mainly due to habitat fragmentation. Their ranges become smaller as human population expands and land use changes, which also means that they have contact with domestic animals, exposing them to diseases that they would be unlikely to be threatened by in the wild. African wild dogs are a very wide-ranging species, too, meaning it is difficult to monitor them in protected areas as they are likely to move around. Additionally, they are often killed by lions and hyenas.<br><br>Conservation groups such as 'Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs' are protecting wild dogs by improving coexistence between dogs and humans, and assisting in land use planning that will give dogs more hunting space to allow their population size to expand. In recent years there have been rebranding efforts in place, proposing to change the species’ name to ‘painted dog’ or ‘painted wolf’. Conservation organizations hope to improve public perception of the animal by doing so, though this definition is not yet widely spread."
zoopedia_description_aldabragianttortoise.txt= "Endemic to the Seychelle Islands, an Indian Ocean archipelago east of the African coast, the Aldabra giant tortoise (or Aldabrachelys gigantea) is a reptilian species capable of growing to extremely large sizes. Males average between 200 and 250 kg, while the smaller females still average between 121 and 159kg. Their shells are a dull, grey-brown colour made up of peaked keratinous plates and their skin is scaly and grey. <br><br>Historically, Aldabra giant tortoises have been hunted for their meat and oil. Between the 17th and 19th Centuries, sailors would capture and keep them on their ship. They were an excellent food supply as the large creatures provided plenty of meat and required very little maintenance while at sea. As a result of this hunting, the Aldabra giant tortoise is the only one of the 18 giant tortoise species that has not gone extinct due to overexploitation. In order to bring the species back from the brink of dying out, captive breeding efforts have meant more giant tortoises have been bred and released back into the wild, while those tortoise set free are protected by conservation efforts."
zoopedia_description_amazongiantcentipede.txt= "The Amazonian giant centipede (or Scolopendra gigantea) is a large, fearsome and predatory arthropod that is native to the forests of South America and the Caribbean. It is capable of catching, envenoming and killing many animals, and has learned specific techniques for catching particular prey. The centipede can reach 30cm in length and can occur in a variety of colours – typically red, yellow, brown or black – with yellow legs and dark stripes between body segments."
zoopedia_description_americanbison.txt= "The American plains bison (or Bison bison bison) is a large ungulate native to the USA and Canada. Bison are characterised by their large head, shoulder hump and forequarters, all of which are covered in a shaggy coat. Their hind-quarters are comparatively less muscled with a thinner coat. Both sexes have horns are similar in size, but males are much heavier due to having more muscle.<br><br>Bison are not currently endangered but were hunted to near extinction in the 19th century, with the original, pre-colonisation population of 50 million being reduced to just 1000. The species was offered widespread protection in the early 20th century, and captive breeding programmes, followed by reintroduction, brought the species back from the brink of dying out. Currently, the bison population is stable but is still threatened by habitat loss, as well as the risk of reduced genetic diversity due to their near extinction and subsequent artificial selection, which occurred through the domestication of the species."
zoopedia_description_antilleaniguana.txt= "The Lesser Antillean Iguana (or Iguana delicatissima) is a large species of lizard endemic to the Lesser Antilles Islands of the Caribbean – specifically Anguilla, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Dominica. It is a critically endangered species, threatened by habitat loss, hunting by feral animals, and hybridization with the invasive green iguana. The Lesser Antillean iguana is grey with a green belly and has a short, blunted face with white scales around the jaw; males have pink jowls and blue scales around the eyes, whereas females lack this colouration and are about two thirds of the size of their male counterparts."
zoopedia_description_bactriancamel.txt= "Domestic Bactrian camels (or Camelus bactrianus) are large ungulates native to Central Asia. They have two humps and thick sandy-coloured wool coats, although they can also be dark brown or white. On average they are 2m tall at the shoulder with an extra 30cm of height added by their humps, and males are significantly larger than females.<br><br>There are two types of Bactrian camel – the domestic and the wild – but the division of these two can be confusing; some domestic Bactrian camels live in the wild (categorised as feral) alongside the true 'wild Bactrian camels'. It has been established that the domestic and wild variants of Bactrian camels are descended from different ancestor species.<br><br>The domesticated camels are not endangered or threatened, and the population remains stable. However, wild Bactrian camels – which are hunted during migrations and predated on by wolves – are critically endangered and near extinction. There are conservation groups working to protect them, and the Gobi Desert where they live is a National Park. However, the camels make such long migrations that it is hard to protect them across their whole range."
zoopedia_description_bairdstapir.txt= "Baird's tapir (or Tapirus bairdii) is an endangered mammal native to the woodlands of Central America. It's one of five species of tapir – four of which live in Central and/or South America. Males and females are similar sizes, although females are slightly larger, and both have a dark brown to black coat, as well as a pale chin and chest when fully grown. Calves, meanwhile, are tan with white spots and stripes; their colouration provides them with camouflage in the dappled light of the woodland where they live.<br><br>The main threat to this endangered species is deforestation, which is destroying their habitat. In order to try and reduce this, conservationists are heavily concentrated on protecting the woodlands and rainforests of Central America. Hunting is also a threat – despite it being illegal to hunt tapirs in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Panama, these laws are rarely enforced."
zoopedia_description_bengaltiger.txt= "The Bengal tiger (or Panthera tigris tigris) is native to India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Western China. It can live in all kinds of environments, including grassland, forests and mangroves, and will hunt large prey such as cloven-hoofed animals like goats, deer and cows (collectively known as ungulates). The Bengal tiger can be identified by its bright orange coat and brown or black stripes, along with a large head, muscular limbs and large teeth. <br><br>The species is endangered, with the numbers alive in the wild continuing to fall. The main threat to Bengal tigers is poaching – they are killed for fur and body parts, the latter of which are desired for traditional medicines. Farmers are also prone to killing them in order to protect their own livestock, despite the fact that tigers preying on this type of animal is rare.<br><br>Various countries are assisting in the ongoing conservation of the Bengal tiger by protecting the areas in which they live. In India, 'Project Tiger' has created breeding reserves in areas where tiger populations are high, and when tigers become old enough, they migrate away from this area of high tiger population to find their own territory. This gives the tigers a wider distribution. For some time, this effort did result in the tiger population recovering, however it is unfortunately back in decline."
zoopedia_description_blackwildebeest.txt= "The black wildebeest (or Connochaetes gnou) is a large ungulate species native to Southern Africa, also known as the 'gnu' after the distinctive noise they make when alarmed. The species is recognisable by a brown-black coat and L-shaped horns, and males can be distinguished from females due to their darker colour and larger size. Both sexes have thick, bushy manes and a long horse-like tail, measuring between 1.7 and 2.2m long, 1.06 to 1.21m tall at the shoulder, and weighing 120 to 193kg.<br><br>Black wildebeest are not currently endangered, but they were almost hunted to extinction in the late 1800s, targeted for their meat and leather, as well as for sport. Because they fed in the same areas as grazing livestock, to whom they could spread diseases, they were also considered pests. Thanks to reintroduction from captive populations, black wildebeest are increasing in number, expanding their range, and are no longer endangered."
zoopedia_description_boaconstrictor.txt= "The boa constrictor is a large species of snake native to Central and South America. They are a ubiquitous species split into 9 subspecies, all of which are capable of living in most environments but mostly found in rainforests, coastal areas and semi-deserts. Although there are many different colours and patterns among these snakes, the typical appearance is pale brown, dark brown and black scales in a rhomboid pattern down the length of the body. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the males and females look different. Males are an average length of between 1.8 and 2.4m, with pelvic spurs around their cloaca that are used to facilitate mating. Females are larger, with an average length of between 2.1 and 3m, whilst they have pelvic spurs they are smaller than the male's."
zoopedia_description_bongo.txt= "The bongo (or Tragelaphus eurycerus) is a secretive, forest-dwelling antelope that lives in the woodlands of Central Africa. They have a tan-to-red coloured coat, white vertical stripes on their torso and pale inner legs, large ears, and a yellow chevron under their eyes. Their main distinguishing features are their large, spiralling, vertical horns. While males and females are similar in size – between 1.1 and 1.3m tall at the shoulder, and 2.15 and 3.15m long – the males are much heavier, averaging 310kg compared to a female's 190kg.<br><br>The species is near threatened, endangered by habitat loss due to deforestation and land use change for agriculture, but also often hunted as a trophy animal due to their large ornamental horns. 60% of the bongo population falls within nature reserves and thus are protected from hunting, but illegal poaching does still occur. Nature reserves also protect the bongo's environment from destruction."
zoopedia_description_bonobo.txt= "Bonobos (or Pan paniscus) live in the forests and wetlands of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and are most closely related to the common chimpanzee (or Pan troglodytes). Out of any species in nature, these two types of ape have the most DNA in common with humans.<br><br>Bonobos have pink lips and dark, forward-facing eyes, small ears, a flat nose with wide nostrils, as well as black hair. Male bonobos are larger than females – averaging 73 to 83cm tall and weighing 39kg – whereas a female stands 70 to 76cm tall and weighs 31kg.<br><br>They are very playful and peaceful creatures, are rarely aggressive towards each other, and have never been known to kill each other. They live in a matriarchal society where females dominate, and the status of males is dictated by the status of their mother.<br><br>Bonobos are endangered due to habitat loss and being poached for bushmeat. Various conservation efforts are being made to preserve the animals and their habitats – the UN and WWF, among others, are monitoring and protecting bonobos, especially within areas that have been designated as National Parks. These organisations are also educating locals on the apes and providing them with jobs in national parks, encouraging long-term respect for their environment and reducing dependence on the bushmeat trade."
zoopedia_description_borneanorangutan.txt= "The orangutan (or Pongo pygmaeus) is native to the island of Borneo, their range also spanning areas of Bornean Indonesia and Malaysia. They are large apes identifiable by their red fur and brown skin, while mature males also have distinct, large cheek pads and throat pouches used for making loud vocalizations to attract females. They are incredibly intelligent animals and have been observed creating and using tools in the wild to acquire food. However, they cannot swim and their range is often limited by rivers that they cannot cross in the wild.<br><br>The Bornean orangutan population has declined by 60% in the past 60 years, with their numbers expected to have halved again by 2025. The main threat to orangutans is habitat loss and fragmentation caused by deforestation, but they are also hunted for bushmeat, and climate change is causing their natural habitat to change. Conservation efforts are being made by assigning areas of forest as protected, but these protected areas are small and need to be expanded to cover more land."
zoopedia_description_brazilianwanderingspider.txt= "The Brazilian wandering spider (or Phoneutria nigriventer) is a species of arachnid native to South America – predominantly in the rainforests, although it does often live in urban areas alongside humans. The spiders are large, venomous and pale brown in colour, with a hairy body and black striations on their legs. Males are slightly smaller than females with a much smaller abdomen, and also have swollen bulbs on the end of their palps, which are the segmented appendages near the mouth and are often used to distinguish the sexes. They have an average leg span of between 130 and 150mm, and an average body size of 17x48mm. A classic behaviour of the Brazilian wandering spider is its defensive posture, whereby it raises its front two sets of legs and leans from side to side."

Males also often have brighter colouration than females."
zoopedia_description_cheetah.txt= "The cheetah (or Acinonyx jubatus) lives in the savannahs and dry woodlands of Central and Southern Africa. They can be recognised by their slim body, deep chest, thin legs and tail, as well as dark 'tear marks' on the face. Not to mention their most distinctive feature – their spots. Cheetahs are famous for being the fastest land animal, reaching up to 70mph when pursuing their prey. This is generally medium-sized mammals such as gazelle and impala.<br><br>The cheetah population is in decline due to habitat loss; their territory having been overtaken by farmland and urban buildings. It is probable that their conservation status will go from 'vulnerable' to 'endangered' in the near future. Conservation efforts by the 'International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'Zoological Society of London' and 'Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs' include promoting ecotourism and creating reserves around land where cheetahs are prevalent in order to maintain their territory and prevention of poaching."
zoopedia_description_chinesepangolin.txt= "The Chinese pangolin (or Manis pentadactyla) is a critically endangered insectivorous species native to India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Taiwan and Southern China. They are small, secretive and slow-moving animals, their most distinguishing feature being their layered armour-like keratinous scales. Chinese pangolins are between 40 and 58cm long with a tail measuring 25 to 38cm. They spend their days sleeping in their burrows, and their nights foraging for ants, termites and other insects.<br><br>The main threat the pangolin faces is illegal hunting and trafficking; it is a highly desired species in traditional medicine and is heavily hunted for its scales, despite there being no evidence that these scales have any medical properties. Police often seize huge numbers of pangolin bodies and/or scales from smugglers and traffickers. There are many efforts to reduce pangolin poaching; including preventative laws, education programmes, rescue and rehabilitation centres for pangolins and ranger training. However, until the demand for traditional remedies decreases, the problem is likely to remain and the number of Chinese pangolins will continue to decrease."

Although not currently endangered, the species is vulnerable to drought and hunting, as they're often viewed by humans as pests. The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, they can spread disease to livestock. Secondly, they can destroy crops on farmland when rooting with their tusks. This has resulted in some pockets of the population being wiped out. <br><br>The common warthog has a large head with a coarse mane of hair and distinctive tusks. The upper tusks are large, thick and blunt, while the lower tusks are short and sharp. Warthogs also have large cartilaginous protrusions on their cheeks.

They have a stocky build with black fur, rounded ears and a long straight snout; plus their most characteristic and distinct visual feature, which is a V-shaped white patch on their chest. The Formosan black bears are sexually dimorphic; in this case the males are much larger than females. The former weigh and measure an average of 135kg and 1.7m, and the latter average 70kg and 1.35m.<br><br>The species is endangered and their numbers are in decline – primarily due to the degradation of their habitat that's brought on by commercial logging and the encroachment of human development into their home forests. They are also victims of commercial poaching, which is an effect compounded by the logging because it gives poachers easy access to areas in which the bears live.<br><br>Taiwan takes a lot of pride in its ursine population and the nation is working to protect them. Many have been tagged with radio collars in order to track them and get an idea of the threats they are facing. This also assists in determining the population size, locating areas that poacher's traps have been set, and mapping the home ranges of the bears to locate and protect dens of mothers with new cubs.

They have black and white fur in a distinctive pattern, with black legs, ears and circles around their eyes. Pandas feed almost exclusively on bamboo and, as a result, are extremely dependent on rich bamboo forests to survive. This is a low energy food, so pandas must eat a lot of it to live and spend most of their waking hours foraging and eating. Their low energy intake also means they produce very tiny and vulnerable cubs.<br><br>The species is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and urbanisation; they are also poached for their fur.

Their average length is 1m – although some specimens can reach almost 2m – and males tend to be larger than females, with a wider girth and longer tail."
zoopedia_description_pygmyhippo.txt= "The pygmy hippopotamus (or Hexaprotodon liberiensis) is a species of medium-sized mammal that lives in the rainforests and swamps of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and the Ivory Coast. They have grey-brown skin, small ears and sturdy legs with four-toed feet, and can usually be found near rivers, where they spend most of their time wallowing and sleeping. On average they are between 75 to 100cm tall, 150 to 175cm long and weigh between 180 and 275kg<br><br>The pygmy hippo is endangered, threatened by the deforestation that has encroached upon their habitat, as well as by poaching. Their wellbeing is further complicated by the fact that their habitat often falls within warzones, which may cause deaths and also makes conservation efforts difficult. There are several national parks within the hippo's range where it is protected, and organisations like the Zoological Society of London are conducting research on their ecology to better understand how to protect them."
zoopedia_description_redpanda.txt= "The red panda (or Ailurus fulgens) is a small mammal that lives in the woodlands of the Himalayas and multiple areas of China. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the giant panda, however it does share some characteristics such as a diet mainly consisting of bamboo. With red fur, black legs, a ringed tail, and white ears and snout, the red panda averages between 50 and 64cm from head to body, with a tail 28 to 59cm long. They are excellent climbers and good swimmers that enjoy living in a varied environment.<br><br>The species is endangered, primarily due to deforestation that is causing habitat loss. However, they are also poached for their fur and are vulnerable to inbreeding; inbreeding depression is caused when the number of animals in a population vastly decreases, meaning the genetic pool is limited and animals are more likely to mate with their relatives resulting in weak offspring. To conserve populations in the wild, many protected areas have been established around their territories, and, in some areas, locals have launched ecotourism start-ups to encourage people to visit and see the red pandas, raising awareness and money for conservation efforts."
zoopedia_description_redruffedlemur.txt= "The red-ruffed lemur (or Varecia rubra) is a critically endangered species of primate native to the Northern Masoala rainforests of Madagascar. With yellow eyes and a black pointed face surrounded by the distinctive red ruff, the lemur's body is covered in thick red fur and it has a black tail, hands and feet. It also has a white patch on the top of its head.<br><br>The species is threatened by habitat loss and hunting, they are particularly vulnerable to this because they require well established forests with tall trees to survive and forage for fruit, nectar and flowers. Therefore it cannot live in young or newly planted forests. They are also frequently hunted for bushmeat. To combat these problems, the Masoala rainforest is a protected national park, but illegal logging and hunting still takes place."
zoopedia_description_reticulatedgiraffe.txt= "Also known as the Somali giraffe, the reticulated giraffe (or Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata) is a subspecies that lives in the savannahs and open forests of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. The reticulated giraffe is distinguishable from other subspecies thanks to its large, polygonal spots, tan to red in colour, that are divided by white interconnecting lines on the animal's fur. While both sexes are extremely tall, the males are significantly taller than females and have well developed bony horns on their head; the horns of the female are smaller and thinner. Giraffes are famous for their long neck, which is used for accessing leaves that are out of reach to other animals.<br><br>Reticulated giraffes are threatened by deforestation and the increase in agricultural land conversion, both of which are destroying their habitats. Furthermore, giraffes often live in areas of civil unrest and are likely to be killed as an indirect of the human conflict occurring in those locations. Many conservation groups such as the 'Reticulated Giraffe Conservation with Pastoralists Initiative' have been established and are dedicated to protecting giraffes. Groups like this install cameras on giraffe trails to track the animals, locate snares and prevent poaching, while this activity also benefits other species that may live in the area. The group also educates locals on giraffes and the local wildlife. <br><br>Extra information: Species disputes and evolution<br><br>The phylogeny of giraffes is a debated subject – current research is in conflict about whether varieties of giraffe are separate species, subspecies, or a combination of the two. Most of the different varieties of giraffe have been separated for extremely long periods of time, so there has been no mixing of DNA between them. This means that speciation is happening or may have already happened. Some research indicates that all giraffes are one species with multiple subspecies, while some indicates that there are four species; more still claim that there are 8 species and subspecies within those."
zoopedia_description_ringtailedlemur.txt= "Like all species of lemur, the ring-tailed lemur (or Lemur catta) is native to Madagascar and is not naturally found anywhere else in the world. Ring-tailed lemurs have a pointed muzzle, cat-like ears, and a long tail that has 12 or 13 white rings, 13 or 14 black rings, and a tip that is always black. They are usually between 39 and 46cm in size with a tail of 56 to 63cm and live in groups called 'troops' that will travel and forage together. Ring-tailed lemurs are omnivorous and will eat fruit, leaves, insects and most other food they can find.<br><br>The ring-tailed lemur is endangered, primarily due to deforestation, mining and the creation of farmland destroying their habitat. They are also hunted for bushmeat and captured for the illegal pet trade. Madagascar can also have harsh weather conditions and extended periods of drought that can kill large numbers of the population. A special reserve called 'Bezà Mahafaly' has been created to protect the lemur population and educate the local community on conservation. The reserve also promotes ecotourism and takes part in drought intervention by introducing water sources during periods of harsh weather."
zoopedia_description_sableantelope.txt= "The sable antelope (or Hippotragus niger) is a species of ungulate that lives in South-Eastern Africa. They have long, notched horns that curve backwards from their face, a tan-to-black coat with a white underbelly, chin and throat, as well as white tear-marks on their face. Males are larger, darker and have longer horns than females. Both sexes graze and browse on the savannah, preferring lightly wooded areas to completely open ones.<br><br>The species is not endangered and is seen in large numbers throughout its range. However, the amount of space available to them has declined – their natural habitat having been reduced by mankind's urban expansion, which has destroyed grazing lands and turned large areas of savannah into farmland. Additionally, sable antelope are hunted for their distinctive horns, not to mention vulnerable to diseases spread by the tsetse fly."
zoopedia_description_saltwatercrocodile.txt= "The saltwater crocodile (or Crocodylus porosus) is an extremely large species of reptile native to the coastal areas of South-east Asia, North Australia and East India. It is an effective and dangerous apex predator, with the males capable of growing between 3.5 to 6m long, and weighing between 200 and 1000kg. Females are significantly smaller, averaging 2.7 to 3.4m and 120-200kg. Both sexes have a broader snout and body compared to other crocodile species, and are tan to greenish grey in colour; there is variation in colour among different populations.<br><br>The species is not endangered, partially due to its ability to swim long distances around the coast when searching for territory. However, its natural range has decreased and is no longer found in much of South-East Asia and China, where it was once widespread."
zoopedia_description_siberiantiger.txt= "The Siberian tiger (or Panthera tigris altaica) – also known as the Amur tiger – is the largest of the cat species. It is characterised by orange-yellow fur with thin, black stripes and a paler undercoat on its belly. Its head is also very large, with strong jaws containing large canines.<br><br>The species was once common and widespread in the Far East of Russia and the North-Eastern borders of China and North Korea, but by the 1940s it had been hunted to near extinction for its fur, with only 40 Siberian tigers remaining in the wild. The population has slowly recovered thanks to conservation efforts in Russia, and there are now 560 individuals in the wild."
zoopedia_description_snowleopard.txt= "Identifiable by its white to grey fur, black rosettes across its body, and black spots on its face, the snow leopard (or Panthera uncia) lives in the mountains of Nepal, Tibet, Northern India, Southern Siberia, Pakistan, Bhutan and Mongolia. The animal's fur is extremely thick and well insulated, which helps it comfortably withstand sub-zero temperatures as low as -25ºC. They mostly feed on mountain goats and sheep, but also hunt birds and rodents.<br><br>The species is endangered for a variety of reasons. Farmers kill them to prevent the leopards killing their livestock, and they are also hunted for their fur and body parts, the latter of which are valued in Chinese medicine. Lastly, habitat degradation has reduced their prey options. Conservation efforts have been made by establishing protected areas and assisting farmers in 'leopard proofing' the land where they keep their livestock, while locals are being educated on the snow leopard. In many areas concerted efforts are also being made to remove poachers' traps."
zoopedia_description_spottedhyena.txt= "The spotted hyena, also known as the laughing hyena (Crocuta crocuta), is native to Sub-Saharan Africa. They are generalist predators that can live in most environments – although they are not found in rainforests or deserts – and their strong forelimbs, well-muscled neck, and comparatively weaker hind limbs give them a distinctive appearance. Their head is broad with a wide snout and they have sandy fur with black spots, as well as a mane down their neck to their mid back.<br><br>It is not an endangered species, although they are affected by habitat loss through human encroachment and also persecution by farmers attempting to protect their livestock. They are not vulnerable to trophy hunting as they are largely regarded as an unattractive animal, but they are poached for their body parts which are used in traditional medicine. They are protected when their range falls into the boundaries of a National Park, and some African countries have legislation marking the spotted hyena as a protected species, but in other areas they are regarded as vermin."
zoopedia_description_springbok.txt= "The springbok (or Antidorcas marsupialis) is a small species of antelope native to the savannahs of Southern Africa. They have lyre-shaped black horns, a tan coat with dark brown markings, a white belly and face, with dark brown tear marks from their eyes to their muzzle. Males and females are a similar size and both have horns, although the male's are more robust.<br><br>Springboks are not endangered so there are no specific conservation efforts for this species. They are easy to breed in captivity, often as game animals and for meat, and are protected in areas where their range falls into nature reserves."
zoopedia_description_thomsonsgazelle.txt= "Thomson's gazelle (or Eudorcas thomsonii) is a small species of grazing mammal that lives in Africa's Serengeti regions of Tanzania and Kenya. It prefers to live in dry grassland – although is also found in woodland – and has a tan coloured back, white underside and a dark stripe on their flank. They also have a tan muzzle, white cheeks and eye region, as well as black streaks running from their eyes to the start of the muzzle. Both sexes have dark, heavily ridged horns – although the male's are longer and more robust – they both measure an average of 55 to 82cm tall, 80 to 120cm long, and weigh between 20 and 35kg.<br><br>The species is not endangered and still live in large numbers, but they are threatened; their population having declined by 60% since 1975 due to the pressures of tourism, change in their habitat, destruction of grassland by wildfire, and the building of roads. They are also frequently hunted for meat. Efforts are being put into protecting Thomson's gazelle by establishing wildlife corridors throughout their habitat that allows them to roam without the risk of roads. Meanwhile, sustainable agriculture is also being encouraged to mitigate habitat destruction and hunting."
zoopedia_description_timberwolf.txt= "Timber wolves (or Canis lupus) are a large canid species that live across most of the Northern hemisphere. Also known as grey wolves, they are large generalist predators that will eat most prey they can catch, and which are capable of living in a wide variety of different environments.<br><br>The appearance of timber wolves can vary widely and is mostly dependent on which population is being observed. There are 38 subspecies, each with adaptations to their specific environments, thus causing their varied appearance. In general, they have a mottled grey-brown fur coat, pointed ears and a long straight snout. In terms of size, the wolves have a slim build with a deep rib cage and long legs.<br><br>The species is not endangered. However, the timber wolf's range has been decreased by 30% due to humanity's expansion into the environment and the subsequent change in land use. Wolves continue to be challenged by human action; they are a wide-ranging species who require large areas for hunting and roaming, which often causes conflict with people as they may kill livestock or scavenge in urban areas. There is no official global wolf protection, although some countries have conservation practices in place to protect their regional wolves."
zoopedia_description_titanbeetle.txt= "The titan beetle (or Titanus giganteus) is an extremely large species that lives in the tropical rainforests of South America. It has a large reddish-brown and black abdomen, black colouration on its legs, antennae and thorax, and pale wings with brown vein structures. The beetle's robust mandibles are strong enough to snap through twigs and, while both sexes have wings, only the males are capable of flight. Like many species, it is threatened by the ongoing destruction of the rainforest habitat that it calls home."
zoopedia_description_westafricanlion.txt= "Although there are an estimated 20,000 lions in the African wilderness today, the West African lion (or Panthera leo leo) numbers far, far fewer. Only 250 still remain across the entire continent, making the subspecies one of the most threatened of its kind in the world. It currently falls under the 'critically endangered' conservation status.<br><br>The reason for the lions' dwindling numbers is twofold. Firstly, they have succumbed to the devastating effects of poaching. Secondly, the ongoing conversion of their habitat has disrupted their way of life, which has finally resulted in dwindling numbers of prey available for them to hunt. Their decline has spurred on a conservation effort to protect the remaining population, including the establishment of major National Parks around the lion's hunting ranges. The key aim being to monitor their continued reproduction and survival.<br><br>To an untrained eye, West African lions look familiar to other subspecies of lion – a rich and sandy coloured fur, deeply darkened tail tuft, and the unmistakable manes boasted by the impressive males. However, the group is a genetically distinct subpopulation of the species, meaning they will never mate with any other types of lion they may encounter in life on the sub-Saharan plains."
zoopedia_description_westernchimpanzee.txt= "The Western chimpanzee (or Pan troglodytes verus) is a subspecies of the common chimpanzee native to the forests of Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. Along with bonobos, they are the closest living relatives of human beings, sharing more than 98% of our DNA. <br><br>They are critically endangered, heavily threatened by the loss of their habitat – something accelerated by deforestation and the expansion of human agriculture. They are also targeted by poachers for bushmeat, traditional medicines and also capture for the illegal pet trade. As a result, all chimpanzees are protected by national and international laws, but enforcement of those laws is weak and remains an ongoing problem. While 30% of chimps live within national parks where they receive ample protection, those living in the wild are very vulnerable from outside threat.<br><br>Western chimpanzees are extremely intelligent and socially capable animals. They have black hair, brown skin and eyes, long arms, hands and feet, with opposable thumbs that allow for more complex motor functions. While the subspecies is not that visually distinct from the Central and Eastern chimpanzees, the population of Western chimpanzees has been isolated for half a million years and is now genetically distinct."
zoopedia_description_westerndiamondbackrattlesnake.txt= "The Western diamondback rattlesnake (or Crotalus atrox) is a species of venomous snake native to the deserts, grassland and scrubland of the USA and Mexico; so named for the pattern of grey and brown scales on its back.

zoopedia_description_westernlowlandgorilla.txt= "The Western lowland gorilla (or Gorilla gorilla gorilla) is native to Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of the Congo and Southern Niger, living and foraging in the rainforests, swamp forests and abandoned farmland there. They have black skin, dark forward-facing eyes, a prominent brow ridge, large nostrils and coarse hair which covers most of their body except the face, ears, hands and feet. Males are much larger than females and, when they mature, the hair on their backs becomes grey and they are identified as 'silverbacks'. Gorillas live in small groups with a silverback in control of the females, younger males and juveniles.<br><br>The species is critically endangered due to deforestation, poaching and the spread of disease – young gorillas leave their home group for a new group when they reach adulthood, and this means that disease can spread very quickly among groups. The Republic of Congo is investing in conservation of their rainforests to prevent deforestation and species loss."
zoopedia_description_yellowanaconda.txt= "The yellow anaconda (or Eunectes notaeus) is a large, yellow-scaled species of constrictor snake with brown-black saddles across its back. It can primarily be found in the tributaries, swamps and marshes of the Paraguay river basin, but can also be located in Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil. As generalist predators, the yellow anaconda will feed on most small to medium sized animals that they are able to catch. The species is known for reaching large sizes – adults can reach an average length of 3.3 to 4.4m, as well as an average weight of 25 to 35kg. The largest specimen ever recorded was 4.6m long and weighed 55kg."

If and when she is receptive, he will mate with her before leaving the burrow. Males may mate with several females during the mating season. The female is pregnant for 7 months before giving birth to 1 cub, which will remain with its mother for 6 months - learning how to forage and dig burrows - before leaving and digging its own. They become sexually mature at 2 years old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_africanbuffalo.txt= "African buffalo mate year-round. A male will track females for signs of oestrus and, upon finding a receptive partner, he will defend her from rival males until he is able to mate with her. The males with higher dominance are more likely to successfully guard and mate. An African buffalo mother's pregnancy lasts 11.5 months and she will give birth to a single calf, which remains close to her until it is between 1 and 2 years old. At this age, males will leave and join a bachelor herd, whereas females will remain with their mother's."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_africanelephant.txt= "To reproduce, a mature male will approach female herds. Any interested female will vocalise towards him; in response he will chase her until she allows him to mate. An elephant's pregnancy lasts 22 months, at which point the female will give birth to a single calf that she will take very close care of. Other female elephants will also help a mother care for her young, too. These calves will remain close to the family herd until they are around 8 years old, at which point the females will remain and the males will move away to form bachelor pods."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_africanwilddog.txt= "In a pack of African wild dogs, only the alpha male and female reproduce. The two are monogamously bonded and will have a litter of pups each year. Subordinate dogs do not have pups but help raise the pups of the alpha pair, and it is thought that this is to prevent the pack from becoming too large for each dog to get enough food."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_aldabragianttortoise.txt= "If a male and female encounter each other during the mating season, the male will invariably attempt to mate by climbing on her back. The female may accept this by remaining still, or reject it by walking away or raising herself high on her legs so that the male slips off. If the female acquiesces, she will carry her fertilised eggs with her for 110 to 250 days until laying a clutch of them in a shallow nest. In the wild, the clutch will number between 4 and 14 eggs, while in captivity this number increases to between 9 and 25. In both cases, however, only 30-50% of these eggs will hatch. When the hatchlings emerge, they live completely independently and will reach sexual maturity between 20 and 30 years old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_amazongiantcentipede.txt= "In order to reproduce, male centipedes deposit a protein parcel containing sperm called a 'spermatophore' on the ground for a female to find. When the female comes across this, she will absorb and use it to fertilise her eggs, laying between 15 and 60 in a burrow in the soil. She guards the eggs until they hatch, regularly licking them to prevent fungus from growing on them. Once hatched, the mother will continue to care for them for approximately 3 months, often carrying them on her underside and wrapping herself around them to guard them. The young centipedes will reach sexual maturity at approximately 2 years old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_americanbison.txt= "During the mating season, bulls will attempt to join female groups and tend the individual females, preventing other males from getting too close. A dominant bull is more likely to succeed in this task; consequently they will also have the chance to mate with more females. The mother will be pregnant for an average of 285 days, giving birth to a single calf. Female calves stay with their mother's herd for their entire lives, whereas males leave at between the ages of 2 and 3, joining a bachelor herd until they are old and strong enough to become a solitary dominant bull."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_antilleaniguana.txt= "Lesser Antillean iguana males have a hierarchy where dominance is signalled by their colouration; the darker grey the scales, the more dominant the individual and the more likely it is for a female to be receptive to them. During the mating season, they will establish a territory and display to females by strutting and engaging in 'head pushing' behaviour with rival males. If interested, a female will approach so he can mount and mate. The mother will then search for a sandy area to dig a tunnel where she will lay her clutch of eggs, which hatch after 3 months and are immediately independent. The young will reach sexual maturity at between 3 and 5-years-old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_bactriancamel.txt= "The dominant male in a harem will mate with the adult females, who will give birth to one calf, occasionally twins, who will remain with their mother and the herd until they are between 3 and 5 years old. Young adults leave their family herd to establish or join an unrelated herd."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_bairdstapir.txt= "A male tapir will track the scent of a female's urine when she moves through his territory. When they meet, he will court her by nudging, sniffing her hindquarters and chasing her. If the female is receptive, she will allow him to mount her and mate, which they will do several times throughout the day while she is fertile. The two will then either stay together or go their separate ways.<br><br>After a pregnancy of 13 months, the mother will give birth to a single calf, which for the first week of its life remains hidden in the undergrowth. The mother will return often to feed the calf, before it can then accompany its mother to forage when it's a week old. They remain with their mother for one or two years, depending on when their mother has another calf."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_bengaltiger.txt= "Male tigers will track receptive females through scent marking and scratches on trees. If the female is receptive the two will mate but then go their separate ways. The female will give birth to a litter of 1 to 4 cubs in a den after a 3-month pregnancy. Tiger mothers begin to train their cubs to hunt when they are around 3 months old and mature enough to leave the den. They will stay with their mother until they are between 2 and 3 years old, at which point they will leave to establish their own territory."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_blackwildebeest.txt= "During the breeding season, dominant bulls will search for receptive females on his territory by smelling their urine, who will then allow him to approach and mate with them. A pregnancy lasts for 8.5 months before the female gives birth to a single calf, which will remain close to its mother for a year, until she gives birth to her next calf. Yearling males leave and join a bachelor herds, whereas females remain with their natal herd."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_boaconstrictor.txt= "During the mating season, female boas will release pheromones that males will track. If more than one male encounters the same female, they will wrestle with each other, the victor then mating with the female. The female will store the male's sperm until she ovulates, using it to fertilise her eggs. She gestates for between 100 and 120 days, giving birth to between 20 and 65 live young, which are independent from birth. Boa constrictors reach sexual maturity between 3 and 4 years old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_bongo.txt= "During the mating season, a male will join a female herd and will court females by gently nudging and nuzzling them, then mating with them if they are receptive. After a pregnancy of 9.5 months, the female will give birth to a single calf, which remains close to their mother until they are around 2 years old. At this point, males will leave and become solitary, while females remain with their mother's herd."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_bonobo.txt= "Bonobos are promiscuous animals, so much so that all mature members of the group will mate with each other regardless of their age or sex. This means it is usually unknown which males fathered which offspring. This is thought to be why bonobo males are gentle towards babies, and also how their communal style of living has evolved. A Bonobo mother will be pregnant for 8 months and give birth to 1 baby, which she will care for closely until the baby is around four years old. The males stay with their mother's group throughout adulthood, whereas bonobo females will leave in search of an unrelated group."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_borneanorangutan.txt= "Mature male orangutans develop cheek and throat pads, which define them as an alpha male. These males, who often have large territories and roam through great distances in the forest, are far more likely to gain the attention of females than beta males, who are younger and do not have cheek pads. When a male and receptive female meet, they will mate. The female will give birth to one baby after a pregnancy of 8 and a half months, caring closely for her child for the first 8 years of its life. The child will stay with her until they are between the ages of 10 and 11, and then leave to establish its own home range."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_brazilianwanderingspider.txt= "During the mating season, the males spend a lot of their time roaming in an attempt to find females. When one is encountered – and if she allows it – he will attempt to mate with her, before moving away quickly afterwards so that she does not kill and eat him. The female lays up to 3000 eggs in several egg sacs, which she will check on and guard until they hatch. When they do, the hatchlings are independent and will move off to live on their own, going through 5 to 10 moults before they are fully grown."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_brazilliansalmonpinktarantula.txt= "The male spider spins a web on the ground, onto which he deposits sperm before absorbs it onto his palps (mouth appendages). He then goes in search of females by roaming the forest floor, both sexes using chemical signals to establish whether other spiders they encounter are the same species, as well as to determine if the female is receptive.<br><br>If she is, the male will approach and she will raise her front legs in a defensive posture. Using his front legs to prevent her from attacking him, he deposits the sperm from his palps in a furrow on her abdomen so she can store it for around 3 months, until she is ready to lay between 500 and 2000 eggs in an egg sac. She will guard this for several weeks until the spiderlings hatch. Salmon pink tarantulas will go through around 10 moults a year until they are fully grown at around 2 to 3-years-old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_cheetah.txt= "Males will track fertile females by the scent of her urine, staying together for several days once they meet and mating multiple times before separating. A female will be pregnant for approximately 3 months and then give birth to a litter of between 2 and 5 cubs, although larger litters of 8 do occur. Cheetah mothers will start teaching their cubs to hunt at 5 months old, and they will become fully independent at about a year old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_chinesepangolin.txt= "During the mating season, male pangolins track a female by scent into her burrow and, if she is receptive, the two will mate before parting ways. The female will be pregnant for approximately 7 to 8 months, although exact times are unknown due to the secretive nature of this species. Once born, the infant remains in the burrow for the first month of its life, before starting to accompany its mother on foraging trips. It will be fully weaned at 3 months old and remain with its mother until she has another infant; usually a year later. Chinese pangolins are fully grown at 2 years old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_commondeathadder.txt= "Males search for females by tracking pheromonal signals. When two adders of the opposite sex encounter one another, the female will coil up slightly to signify that she's interested, allowing the male to climb on top of her. He will put his whole body on top of her, wrapping his tail underneath hers, and the two will mate. Between 6 and 9 months later, the mother will give birth to a litter of 5 to 20 offspring, which are independent from birth. The males will reach sexual maturity at 2 years old, whereas females will mature slightly later, at 3 and a half years old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_commonostrich.txt= "During the breeding season, a top hen and her group of females will search for a dominant male with good territory. The group will remain with this chosen male for the entire breeding season. In order to mate, the male will court the top hen with a 'dance' in which he alternates the beating of his wings and ritualistic pecking at the ground, 'wooing' the female into crouching down and allowing him to mate with her. Then, he will dig a nest; a shallow dip in the ground in which the top hen will lay 7 - 10 eggs.<br><br>Subsequently, the male will mate with all females in the group. These females will each lay their eggs around the top hen's, who in turn will then remove some of the eggs that are not hers. Once approximately 20 eggs are in the nest (up to a total of 60 may have been laid) the top hen will incubate them during the day, while the alpha male will incubate them during the night. After 35 to 45 days, the eggs will hatch and the male will take care of them until they are about 10 months old and capable to fend for themselves. After 18 months the ostriches will be full size, and between 2.5 and 4.5 years old they will be able to reproduce themselves."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_commonwarthog.txt= "Male warthogs have two strategies for mating. These are called 'tending' and 'roaming'. A tending male will join a sounder of females during the mating season and block other males from coming close; as well as try to stop females going to other males. Roaming males search for multiple sounders and attempt to mate with females from these groups, often competing with the tending male. The female common warthogs are pregnant for 5-6 months before giving birth to 1 to 5 piglets in their burrow. These young piglets reach maturity at 2 years old, although males are unlikely to mate for the first time until they are 4 to 5 years old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_easternbrownsnake.txt= "After emerging from their underground burrows after winter hibernation, males then search for females by tracking chemical signals, mating together if he finds a receptive partner. The female lays her eggs in an underground burrow – often the abandoned burrow of a small mammal – and will guard them for about 5 weeks before leaving them for good. The eggs will hatch after 11 weeks and the hatchlings are completely independent from when they emerge."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_formosanblackbear.txt= "During the mating season, males will track the females who move through their large territory by the scent of their urine. When the two meet, they will have a brief courtship before mating and going their separate ways. The female will be pregnant for 6 to 7 months and will, during the late weeks of her pregnancy, locate a den in a rock crevice or hollow tree. This is where she will give birth to between 1 and 3 cubs, who will stay with their mother for 2 years. After this point she is likely to mate again, while her initial cubs will leave and attempt to establish their own territories."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_galapagosgianttortoise.txt= "During the mating season, males and females will gather in the humid highlands of the islands; the former tracking the latter by their scent, warding off any rival males by biting, or with mating displays in which they extend their neck and stand as tall as they can. When a male does encounter a female, he will ram her with his shell, chase her and bite her legs – in return, she will either run away or allow him to mate with her, which she does by laying low on the ground and withdrawing her legs. The male may continue to ram her with his shell to get her into the right position, and will then mount her.<br><br>Thereafter, the female will begin a repetitive nest building behaviour that involves digging a 30cm deep hole with her back legs; she repeats this until she is happy and lays a clutch of 4 to 16 eggs inside. A female will lay between 1 and 4 clutches per breeding season, covering the nests over with a muddy plug made of soil and urine, before leaving the eggs to incubate in the sun.

The young lions themselves mature differently depending on their sex – the males will leave to acquire their own pride as they grow older, while the young females will remain with the mother. If the alpha male is ousted or killed by his challenger, the newly dominant lion will kill the cubs that are not his. This is because the pride's females will only mate while they do not have cubs to look after."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_westernchimpanzee.txt= "Chimpanzees are promiscuous animals, with both males and females mating with multiple partners throughout their lifetime. The alpha male gets first pick of a female partner, while some males may keep their chosen females away from other males because of their promiscuity. The pregnancy of a female chimp lasts 8 months before giving birth to a single infant, which the mother will take care of until it reaches around 4 years old. At this point, the offspring will begin to distance from its mother. It's at this age that young males will begin to form close bonds with other males within the group, while females will begin to explore away from the family group. Then, at 10 years old, the females will leave in search of an unrelated group, while the males remain with their original family."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_westerndiamondbackrattlesnake.txt= "Males search for females by tracking pheromonal signals; the female will signal her receptivity by becoming passive and allowing the male to climb on top of her. He will put his whole body on top and wrap his tail underneath hers, and then they will mate. Between 6 to 7 months later, the mother will give birth to a litter of 8 to 25 offspring, which are independent from birth. They will reach sexual maturity by 3 years old."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_westernlowlandgorilla.txt= "When a female gorilla is fertile, she will slowly approach the silverback and attempt to get his attention by maintaining eye contact and puckering her lips. If he does not respond, she will pound the ground near him; if the bid is successful, the male will mate with her. The mother is pregnant for 8.5 months before giving birth to one baby, which she will care for closely until the infants are around 4-years-old, when their offspring begin to gain significant independence. At between 9 and 10 years old, young gorillas both male and female will leave their family group; females will search for a group to join, whereas males will be solitary for some time until they are mature enough to become silverbacks and form their own group."
zoopedia_reproductiondescription_yellowanaconda.txt= "To mate, a female yellow anaconda will release pheromones attracting tracking males to her chemical signals. Throughout this process, it's possible that multiple males can find the same female – in this situation, anacondas may form a 'mating ball' in which many male snakes become entwined around one female. These balls can remain untangled for weeks. Usually, it is the largest male that wins access to the female in order to mate, which normally takes place in water. After 6 months, the female will give birth to between 4 and 82 live young, which are independent from birth and reach sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years old."
